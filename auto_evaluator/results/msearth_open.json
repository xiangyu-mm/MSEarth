The figure illustrates the nearly constant amplitude of the zonal semiannual equatorial wind stress across the basin, which is presumed to be remotely driven by the double passage of the monsoon system each year. This wind stress is almost in phase across the basin, contributing to the semiannual signal observed in sea level variations. The westward equatorial wind stress during specific times of the year generates westward equatorial surface currents, which, through geostrophic balance, result in lower equatorial sea levels. Additionally, the integration paths of forced and reflected Kelvin waves, such as those along the characteristics AB and CAB shown in the figure, demonstrate how these waves contribute to the highs and lows of sea level at the eastern boundary.

ILAS measured 14 circumpolar points at nearly the same latitude daily, resulting in a maximum of 140 potential measurements per 10-day period. However, due to issues such as telemetry data acquisition problems and significant electric noise, the actual number of measurements inside the vortex ranged between 110 and 140 per period. The blank areas in the figure indicate regions where no ILAS data were obtained inside the vortex. The polar vortex forms progressively from higher altitudes to lower altitudes, causing the altitude range of the vortex at the latitude of ILAS measurements to vary over time. For instance, during December 1996 and January 1997, ILAS observed the vortex primarily at higher altitudes, such as above a certain threshold in early January. The boundary of the polar vortex was determined at each altitude level, and only data within the vortex were analyzed. This figure highlights the spatial and temporal variability of ILAS measurements inside the vortex, which is influenced by the asymmetrical positioning of the vortex relative to the polar axis. Consequently, ILAS alternately observed inside and outside the vortex, leading to a non-uniform dataset.",

The Bíldudalur area is situated on the western shore of Bíldudalsvogur Bay, in the southern part of Arnarfjörður fjord. The main map illustrates the summit plateau of Bíldudalsfjall Mountain, located at an elevation of approximately 600 meters above sea level, and the steep headwall, which rises 400 meters and faces southeast. This headwall is deeply incised by two prominent gullies: Gilsbakkagil gully to the south and Búðargil gully to the north. Sediment from these gullies has formed large debris fans extending down to the shoreline. The Gilsbakkagil cone is emphasized due to its natural state, whereas Búðargil has been significantly altered by man-made deflection and protective structures, represented by the double-line symbol on the map. Smaller gullies, collectively referred to as the Milligil gullies, are located between the two larger basins. Gradients on the slope vary between 30° and 40°. The regional map includes asterisks marking the locations of nearby meteorological stations, which provide data on temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions relevant to slush-flow events.",

To address these issues, a combination of soil conservation techniques was implemented, including the construction of palisades made from bamboo stakes and tree trunks to retain sediment and control water flow. These measures, combined with the exclusion of grazing and agricultural activities, created conditions conducive to vegetation growth. Over time, revegetation (b) occurred, with herbaceous and shrub species establishing themselves, stabilizing the gully walls, and protecting the soil surface.

In the southwestern United States, porphyry Cu deposits are associated with granitic magmas from three distinct magmatic epochs, with the majority forming in southern Arizona during the emplacement of Late Cretaceous calc-alkaline monzogranites. Porphyry Mo deposits are distributed throughout the region and are classified into two types based on the bulk composition of associated granitic rocks: (1) \"Climax\"-type deposits, associated with alkalic syenogranite porphyries, primarily formed during the Mid-Tertiary magmatic event in the Rocky Mountains and eastern Great Basin, and (2) \"Quartz-monzonite\"-type deposits, associated with monzogranite porphyries, formed during both Cretaceous and Mid-Tertiary magmatism, primarily in the Great Basin. Samples of intrusive rocks directly related to porphyry Cu deposits were obtained from Arizona and the Great Basin, including deep drill cores and fault-exposed segments of mineralizing granodiorite or monzogranite.

The map is divided into three regions—southern, central, and northern—based on distinct paleoflow characteristics. In the southern region, AMS data indicate a parallel-unimodal flow pattern, suggesting sediment transport predominantly to the north-northeast, consistent with observations of upstream imbrication in sandstones from Sites 40, 41, 44, and 45. These sites are part of the LaHood Formation, a fan-delta sequence that prograded into the basin from an active fault along the southern basin margin. In the central region, AMS data reveal a parallel-bipolar flow pattern, likely resulting from interfingering of sediments derived from both the northern and southern shorelines. In the northern region, AMS measurements indicate a return to a parallel-unimodal pattern, with paleoflow predominantly towards the southeast. \n\nThe inset block diagram provides a paleogeographic interpretation of the basin, highlighting major features such as the southern basin margin with alluvial fans, a central depositional trough trending east-west, and shallow water along the northern basin margin. The paleoflow directions inferred from AMS data align with sedimentary observations, including a northward decrease in grain size, sand content, and sandstone/shale ratio. Additionally, sedimentary structures such as hummocky cross-stratification in sandstones and comparisons with muddy tempestites suggest storm-generated currents played a significant role in sediment transport. The northern shoreline is interpreted as east-west trending, located several kilometers north of its northernmost exposure, with geostrophically balanced storm-induced currents influencing sediment deposition. Overall, the AMS data provide a detailed reconstruction of sediment transport and paleoflow dynamics within the basin during this interval.",

The sequence began with a magnitude 4.5 earthquake on November 13, 2010, followed by a magnitude 5.4 earthquake on November 14, marking the onset of the main sequence. Over the course of the sequence, 82 earthquakes with magnitudes of 4.5 or greater were identified using surface wave analysis. This sequence is notable for the unusually high number of moderate-sized earthquakes, comparable to the aftershock sequence of a magnitude 7–8 main shock, despite the largest earthquake being only magnitude 5.5. Seventy percent of the cumulative seismic moment was generated within the first day of the sequence, and 83 percent within the first week. Earthquake activity in the region continued at a reduced rate through August 2011.",

The Crevillente fault is a 150-km-long dextral strike-slip fault that was active during the late Miocene and early Tortonian, contributing to the westward emplacement of the Alborán Domain units of the internal zones. This tectonic activity produced a regional morphostructure with northeast–southwest-trending ranges of Jurassic limestones separated by Triassic gypsums and Cretaceous-Tertiary marls.

These include the Crevillente fault, the Alhama de Murcia fault, the Palomares fault, and the Bajo Segura fault. Strike-slip left-lateral faults, consistent with the current stress field, have been created or reactivated in the region since the Tortonian, affecting Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits.

Tegel Airport, labeled as “TXL,” is a prominent feature in the image. Bright spots visible in the image are often caused by architectural lighting that shines directly into space, appearing blue due to the image’s color balance, though such lights would appear “cold white” to the human eye. The lighting differences across Berlin reflect historical variations in public lighting infrastructure, with much of Germany’s street lighting being decades old, and approximately one-third believed to be over 20 years old.

The maps illustrate the spatial variability of sea ice concentration, highlighting regions of high concentration within the ice pack and areas of retreating or advancing ice edges. Notably, within the ice pack, large patches of high-concentration ice include significant areas of newly formed first-year ice, reflecting the dynamic processes of ice formation and melting. The interannual variability in the locations of these high-concentration patches at the SM underscores the spatial variability in the timing of new ice formation.

The barotropic stream function represents a vertically integrated quantity, capturing the combined effects of currents at various depths, which complicates its interpretation. For example, the barotropic circulation does not fully reflect the local cyclonic surface anomaly induced by cooling near the African coast due to compensating effects from deeper positive heat anomalies beneath the cooling region. By year 2, the barotropic stream function exhibits a distinct dipolar pattern, with a negative anomaly in the north and a positive anomaly in the south, extending in a northeast-southwest direction from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This dipolar feature is primarily influenced by deeper transports. By year 3, a negative anomaly in the Caribbean Sea indicates a cyclonic flow extending from the surface to deeper layers. During year 4, a positive anomaly north of South America shifts northwestward, while a negative anomaly intensifies southeast of it, coinciding with westward movement of heat content anomalies in deeper layers. By year 5, the positive heat anomaly near the continental slopes drives an anticyclonic circulation anomaly, shaping the barotropic stream function anomaly. These anomalies reflect the dynamic response of the ocean to surface cooling, including adiabatic changes in temperature structure below the mixed layer. The meridional overturning stream function anomalies provide complementary insights into the vertical redistribution of mass and heat.",

This optical illusion can mislead viewers by inverting the perception of landforms.

The figure highlights several key features, including high concentrations in the lower troposphere over land and a decrease in concentrations as air moves over the ocean. Notably, there is a pronounced tongue of higher concentrations at altitudes above and across all longitudes, between specific latitudes during September. This feature aligns with a band of westerly winds in the middle and upper troposphere, which, although weaker in September compared to March, still significantly influences the tracer distribution. Additionally, due to strong convection, the vertical distribution at tropical latitudes remains relatively uniform.",

For contour lines representing PM₂.₅ concentrations greater than or equal to a specific threshold, the largest plume coverage areas correspond to scenarios C0, C3, and C4.

North of Crete, the crust thins significantly beneath the central Cretan Sea, where it is associated with a fault system extending to the base of the crust. Three sedimentary basins with maximum thicknesses were identified in the Cretan Sea, highlighting the complex subsurface structure in this region. This figure provides an example of the modeling process used to analyze the seismic data in the Cretan Sea.",

The comparison reveals significant changes in mangrove community composition and distribution due to subsidence. Mixed mangrove communities, primarily comprising Bruguiera spp., Xylocarpus spp., and Lumnitzera spp., along with mono-dominant Bruguiera spp. communities, were unable to survive the subsidence. In contrast, the seaward mangrove species Rhizophora mucronata successfully colonized the former landward mangrove zones that were previously dominated by Bruguiera gymnorhiza. This colonization is attributed to the high density of propagules from nearby unaffected Rhizophora mucronata populations. Meanwhile, landward mangroves have migrated to former terrestrial zones, but their density remains low due to limited propagule availability, unfavorable soil conditions caused by coral debris deposition after the tsunami, and competition from dense undergrowth of mangrove associates such as Caesalpinia crista, Typha angustifolia, and Fimbristylis littoralis. These ecological shifts highlight the resilience of seaward mangroves and the challenges faced by landward mangroves in re-establishing themselves in altered habitats.",

Hatched regions in (a) and (b) indicate areas of stronger rising motion (ω < -4 μbar s⁻¹), while dotted regions denote stronger sinking motion (ω > 4 μbar s⁻¹). In (a), the coastal mountain range in CNTRL induces a topographically forced vertical circulation characterized by a strong descending branch along the coast, associated with significant adiabatic warming. A narrow ascending branch approximately 10 km onshore is evident, driven by topographic lifting. The compensating descending flow at the coast and offshore suppresses the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) inversion, steepening its slope and enhancing coastal baroclinicity and the coastal jet. In (b), the vertical circulation for FLAT is primarily tied to low-level thermal forcing, with updrafts over land and sinking motion confined further offshore and above 980 mbar. Panel (c) highlights the CNTRL-FLAT difference field, showing increased topographically enhanced subsidence along the coast for CNTRL (hatched region at the coastline, greater than 5 μbar s⁻¹, between 1000 and 960 mbar). The absence of topographic effects in FLAT results in a weaker and more horizontally diffuse MABL inversion, leading to a coastal jet that extends well inland.**",

Interface I, characterized by a sharp contrast in radar wave fluctuations, is proposed as the base of the Eratosthenian basalt layer, consistent with studies on the burial depth of the Imbrian unit beneath the Eratosthenian basalt. Stratum e, averaging approximately 4 meters thick, is attributed to Imbrian regolith formed prior to the deposition of the Eratosthenian basalt. This layer exhibits relatively low reflectance, indicative of heavily fractured rocks due to billions of years of impact mechanical weathering. Stratum g, composed of deeper and older lava flows, displays vertical superposition layering, including a subinterface marked by black vertical arrows, which may represent intermittent lava flows or pyroclastic rocks. The black solid line roughly delineates the top of layer d. The reflectance profile suggests that the formation of Imbrian basalt in the vicinity involved three major lava flow events, with stratum e-f representing the latest flow. Variations in depth and inclination of interfaces, such as the southward dip of interface I and the northward dip of interface III, provide evidence for directional lava flow dynamics.",

The revision process involved dividing the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles areas into blocks, assigning initial intensity levels based on Dewey et al.'s map, and correlating these intensities with the number of red-tagged buildings in each block. For areas with relatively uniform building coverage, primarily residential neighborhoods, the intensity levels were adjusted based on the observed rates of red-tagged buildings and the average trend between site intensity and damage.

Casey Lake and Silver Lake were selected due to their contrasting water quality conditions and the authors' prior research experience in these lakes. Casey Lake exhibits relatively good water quality, attributed to its watershed consisting of forested land, grasses, and parkland. In contrast, Silver Lake suffers from poor water quality due to its watershed being predominantly composed of crop and pasture land (80%), with the remainder consisting of urban and forested areas. The poor water quality in Silver Lake is primarily caused by urban and agricultural runoff, leading to excessive nutrient and sediment enrichment. Silver Lake has been identified as a high-priority site by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and was listed on the 303(d) Impaired Waters List in 1998, 2002, and 2004. Sampling efforts for water quality measurements were conducted at 21 sites in Casey Lake and 20 sites in Silver Lake during the study period, spanning June to October 2004.",

The shelf is characterized by an inner, narrow belt of uneven rocky terrain and an outer, broader belt with a relatively even surface interrupted by depressions of varying depth. Conspicuous transverse trenches, often trough-like in character, are observed, typically terminating abruptly landward in a corresponding zone. These features are interpreted as geomorphological evidence of old, sub-aerially eroded fault lines, along which uplift of the adjacent landmass has occurred. The transverse channels are likely distal remnants of pre-uplift river valleys that were subsequently reshaped by glacial erosion during the Pleistocene. Additionally, the map depicts the drainage systems of the Scandinavian landmass, which were influenced by the Tertiary uplift. Two distinct river types are evident: (a) eastern consequent rivers, flowing down the gentle slope toward the Baltic Sea and Skagerrak, and (b) western rivers with steep gradients, which carved deep valleys into the western slope, later modified by glacial activity into fjords. These western rivers often exhibit angular patterns, following structural weaknesses in the bedrock, and in some cases, have captured the headwaters of eastern drainage systems. Broken lines on the map indicate inferred marginal fault lines, emphasizing the structural control on the region's geomorphology.",

The overlying sequences remain undisturbed, indicating the early timing of faulting. The seismic character of the PTI mega-sequence, including its distinctive small-scale faulting, closely resembles the Permian seismic sequence observed onshore in Jameson Land, providing a stratigraphic correlation between the two basins. The top of the PTI unit is marked by a significant shift in seismic character, transitioning from high-amplitude reflections to a well-bedded section with lower-amplitude reflections. This boundary is interpreted to represent a major lithological change from carbonates and chert to sandstones and shales, similar to transitions described in onshore areas. Additionally, the uppermost part of the succession exhibits onlap onto the Danmarkshavn Ridge and localized erosional truncation above intra-basinal highs associated with salt pillows. The seismic resolution in this interval is generally good, particularly within the Danmarkshavn Basin and along the Danmarkshavn Ridge.",

The Proterozoic erosional surface, represented by the unconformity, is prominently exposed along a nearly linear, NW-trending trace in the southern part of the study area, extending from Floyfjellet to Krumfjellet. This surface truncates progressively older OS strata toward the southeast, confirming its nature as a major stratigraphic break rather than a fault. The regional outcrop pattern is controlled by macroscopic NW-trending folds of Caledonian age, with the unconformity occupying the northeastern limb of a large antiform in the southern area. OS rocks are exposed in the core of this antiform, while YS rocks are found on its NE-dipping limb and within the adjacent synform. The northeastern limb of the synform is obscured by the Recherchebreen glacier, but the unconformity is inferred to continue beneath the glacier along the SW-dipping fold limb. West of Recherchebreen, the lower stratigraphic units of the YS are exposed, with progressively older rocks cropping out eastward toward the glacier. East of the glacier, the Proterozoic Magnethøgda Sequence, formerly known as the \"Antonlabreen Succession,\" is exposed in a broad antiformal arch and is interpreted as the continuation of the OS from the southern area. The presence of distinctive lithologies, such as feldspathic quartzite and hematitic marble, supports the correlation between the OS and the Magnethøgda Sequence, suggesting that the angular unconformity lies beneath Recherchebreen. Additionally, the map illustrates the potential location of a major Caledonian strike-slip terrane boundary beneath Recherchebreen, extending into Torellbreen. The linear trace of the unconformity and its consistent stratigraphic truncation provide insights into the paleodip of OS strata prior to YS deposition, indicating a southerly apparent paleodip.",

Dots along the trajectories represent midmonth positions of the eddy centers, with months labeled along the tracks to indicate temporal progression. The eddy center translations exhibit an overall west-southwestward movement, although individual trajectories vary significantly. Some anticyclones (e.g., A1, A3, A4, A6, A31) tend to move predominantly westward, while others (e.g., A2, A5, A7, A10, A32) display a more southwestward motion. Cyclonic eddies follow similar west-southwestward paths, with no significant difference in velocity distributions between anticyclones and cyclones. Certain eddy trajectories appear influenced by deep topography, as evidenced by \"stalling periods\" observed for anticyclonic eddy A1 near the ABR, as well as for A7, C4, and C6. In contrast, eddy translations are more regular in regions with less pronounced topographic features (e.g., A2, A6, C7). The mean velocities of eddy centers are approximately 2.3 cm/s for anticyclones and 2.3 cm/s for cyclones, with maximum monthly speeds reaching 4.4 cm/s and 3.6 cm/s, respectively. Topographic features are represented in the background, highlighting their potential influence on eddy movement.",

Notably, two mega-sequences, CPI and CPII, are observed on the western flank of the Danmarkhavn Ridge. Mega-sequence CPI is characterized by variable amplitude, low-continuity reflectors, with rapid thickness variations, while CPII is defined by relatively continuous, high-amplitude reflectors. The Jurassic succession is divided into three mega-sequences—JI, JII, and JIII—corresponding to the Lower, Middle, and Upper Jurassic. The lower part of mega-sequence JI shows a high-amplitude reflector at its base, indicative of either shale, coal, or evaporite deposits, and exhibits significant continuity and parallel bedding. The Paleocene succession is marked by a distinctive reflector, with a non-depositional hiatus observed in the central part of the Danmarkshavn Basin. Mega-sequence TII is distinguished by continuous, high-amplitude reflectors and a strong volcanic horizon at its base. In the Thetis Basin, mega-sequences show variable onlapping patterns, with some areas experiencing erosional truncation, especially near the Danmarkshavn Ridge. The section further demonstrates the structural complexities in the region, including faulting and tilting that influence sediment distribution.",

In panel (a), the simulated additional warming due to vegetation dynamics is concentrated in the northern mid-to-high latitudes, particularly in the Arctic, and in semiarid regions of the subtropics, with warming typically reaching significant levels. This warming pattern closely aligns with surface albedo changes and subsequent alterations in the surface energy balance. In panel (b), the \"climate change only\" effect of vegetation dynamics in the subtropics is minimal, with many regions showing cooling due to reduced vegetation cover. The global mean warming in this scenario is negligible compared to panel (a), as regional warming and cooling effects largely cancel out.

The analysis reveals substantial fluctuations in water-table depth across observation wells, which are largely driven by seasonal variability in precipitation and groundwater abstraction, particularly in north-central India and Gujarat, areas known for high groundwater recharge rates due to their higher specific yields. \n\n**b**. Same as panel **a**, but using recharge data from the PCR-GLOBWB model. The model confirms high groundwater recharge in north-central India and Gujarat, which is consistent with the water-table fluctuation method, although variability in recharge across regions like south India is noted due to differences in bedrock characteristics and groundwater systems influenced by canal networks and stream–aquifer interactions.\n\n**c**. Change in groundwater recharge (trend/year multiplied by the total duration from 1996 to 2010) for observation wells, estimated using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope method.

The westerly jet in the Northern Hemisphere winter is located around mid-latitudes, while the easterly jet in the Southern Hemisphere summer exhibits a slanted structure above the mesosphere. The negative winter maximum in momentum flux near the lower stratosphere is connected to the mesospheric maximum in the Northern Hemisphere, and similarly, the positive summer maximum near the lower stratosphere is linked to the mesospheric maximum in the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, a dominant path of gravity waves is observed propagating from the lower stratosphere to the mesosphere in the Southern Hemisphere, although no corresponding path is seen in the Northern Hemisphere winter. These patterns suggest that gravity waves penetrating from the lower atmosphere tend to focus into mesospheric jets, influencing the latitudinal distribution of momentum flux convergence and effectively decelerating the jets. Hemispheric asymmetry in the mesospheric jets may partly result from differences in the source latitudes of gravity waves between seasons. (b) Ray tracing results illustrating gravity wave propagation in an idealized background westerly wind field (thick contours, in $\\textrm{m s}^{-1}$). The initial wave parameters include westward wavenumber vectors in the winter hemisphere and eastward wavenumber vectors in the summer hemisphere, consistent with the simulated momentum flux distribution in panel (a). Thin curves represent the ray paths of gravity waves launched from the lower stratosphere, with dominant sources being high mountains in winter and strong convection in summer.

Bounding surfaces are classified into a hierarchy based on their cross-cutting relationships, lateral continuity, geometry, and association with sedimentary structures. First-order surfaces bound mesoforms (e.g., dunes), second-order surfaces define macroforms (e.g., bars), and third-order surfaces delineate channels. At Baildon Bank, the lower outcrop contains downcurrent-dipping bounding surfaces indicative of downstream accretion on a midchannel bar, with palaeoflow towards the west or southwest. Overlying bar-top deposits exhibit large cross-stratification sets with similar palaeoflow, transitioning downstream into the accretion unit. Higher in the section, trough cross-stratification with a southerly palaeoflow suggests channel switching within a braided river system. A third-order bounding surface near the top marks an internal erosion surface, potentially reflecting short-term channel switching or longer-term channel stacking. At Elland, three distinct channel sandbodies are identified, separated by erosion surfaces and abandonment facies. The lower sandbodies are concave lenses interpreted as deposits of small, low-sinuosity distributary channels, while the upper sandbody is a broader sheet sandstone attributed to a larger braided river system. Changes in palaeocurrent direction and sandbody geometry reflect channel relocation over time. At Greetland Quarry, long, low-angle lateral accretion surfaces dip westward, with small-scale cross-stratification trending south. The deposits lack fining-upward trends or vertical changes in bedform size, distinguishing them from conventional lateral accretion models. Together, these bounding surfaces and sedimentary structures reveal the complex depositional history and channel dynamics of the Rough Rock.",

The Longitudinal Valley in eastern Taiwan is widely regarded as the suture zone between the Luzon arc, situated on the Philippine Sea plate, and the Eurasian continental margin. This suture zone, which may have originated as a submarine arc–prism boundary prior to the collision, now marks the boundary where the Luzon arc is colliding with the Asian continent. The collision has resulted in the formation of the Coastal Range and the propagation of the orogenic belt southward. \n\nSouth of Taiwan, the oceanic crust of the South China Sea (32–15 Ma) is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea plate along the Manila trench, while to the east, the Philippine Sea plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian continent along the Ryukyu trench. The Philippine Sea plate moves northwestward at an azimuth of approximately 310° at a rate of 82 mm/yr. The convergence velocity between the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate is approximately 7 cm/yr, increasing progressively southward. The collision zone exhibits three distinct tectonic stages from south to north: subduction, initial collision, and advanced collision. \n\nGeological provinces in the collision zone include the Manila trench, the accretionary prism of the Hengchun Ridge, the Southern Longitudinal Trough (a collision suture basin), the submarine mélange of the Huatung Ridge, the forearc basin of the Taitung–North Luzon Trough, and the volcanic arc of the North Luzon Ridge. Key stratigraphic units, such as the Fukang Sandstone and Loshui Sandstone, provide evidence of tectonic processes during the collision. The Fukang Sandstone, incorporated into the Lichi Mélange, is thought to have originated from the Loshui Sandstone, with their current separation attributed to movement along the Longitudinal Valley fault.

Additionally, the figure highlights fast-varying, small-scale disturbances in velocity vectors near a seamount, which rises approximately 1000 meters from the seafloor with its summit located just 200 meters below the sea surface.

The Komandorskie Islands and the Near Islands are situated on an extensive triangular platform, with the Near Islands consisting of Attu, Agattu, and the Semichi Islands. The Rat Islands, located eastward of the Near Islands and separated by the Buldir sea depression, feature a narrow uplift with complex outlines. The Rat Islands include Buldir, Kiska, Little Kiska, Little Sitkin, Rat, and Amchitka islands, along with smaller volcanic islands such as Semisopochnoi to the north. (3) The map also outlines the submarine trench and highlights the presence of deep canyons crossing the southern slope of the arc obliquely. Notable canyons include the Murray Canyon in the Rat Islands zone and the Heck Canyon at the border between the Rat and Near Islands. Additionally, a series of shorter canyons, including Rat Canyon, cuts the southern slope of the Rat Islands. In the Near Islands, the southern slope is intersected by canyons such as Agattu, Abraham, Etienne, and Stalemate, with Stalemate Canyon being the largest and most prominent, extending nearly east-west. The mutual arrangement and configuration of the islands and their surrounding bathymetric features exhibit a complex morphology.",

During AS, the amplitude is larger over the coast and the Atlantic Ocean, while it is smaller over land compared to JJ. The increased oceanic cloud amplitude in AS corresponds to the emergence of a southern maximum in the meridional wind amplitude, suggesting a potential relationship between this southward feature and the wave-induced modulation of cloudiness over the ocean.

This limitation is particularly pronounced in urban environments, where increased crown overlap is common due to tree management practices such as closer spacing, reduced resource competition, and pollarding. At Highgate Cemetery, the uneven age structure, characterized by a mix of older trees with large crowns and younger trees filling canopy gaps, further contributes to discrepancies between TLS and ALS-derived crowns. The BIRCH segmentation method used in ALS processing assigns similar crown radii regardless of underlying morphology, leading to errors in crown structure representation. These inaccuracies are exacerbated by the low ALS pulse density, which limits the ability to capture individual crown morphology and tree apexes.",

Additionally, the snowpack's depth and water equivalent at the end of winter do not account for the portion of winter precipitation lost to sublimation, which can represent up to 9-13% of the total winter precipitation, as estimated by Liston and Sturm (1998).",

Errors are evaluated across five synthetic landscape environments with varying spectral characteristics (y-axis), three water indices (vertical panels), and three thresholding methods: ‘optimal,’ ‘zero,’ and ‘Otsu’ (horizontal panels). Sub-pixel waterline extraction consistently demonstrated lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and narrower error distributions compared to whole-pixel extraction in 38 of 45 scenarios, indicating higher accuracy and precision in reproducing the reference waterline position and shape. This trend was most pronounced under ‘optimal’ thresholding, where sub-pixel waterlines were 2.1 to 5.8 times more accurate than whole-pixel waterlines. Even under the less accurate ‘zero’ thresholding, sub-pixel waterlines exhibited significantly lower error variance (1.9 to 4.6 times lower) than whole-pixel waterlines, suggesting better consistency in relative waterline shape reproduction. \n\nKey differences were observed across environments: sub-pixel waterlines performed better in low-contrast environments like tidal mudflats and wetland vegetation, where RMSE and standard deviation were lower, but struggled in high-contrast environments like sandy beaches, where undulating artifacts were more prominent. The MNDWI and NDWI indices showed reduced accuracy and precision in high-contrast environments due to their sensitivity to small changes in land-water spectral ratios, while the third index maintained consistent performance across all environments. Notably, the ‘zero’ threshold approach failed to extract waterlines in tidal mudflat environments for MNDWI and the third index due to the spectral similarity between wet mud and turbid water. The automated ‘Otsu’ thresholding method improved sub-pixel waterline accuracy and consistency compared to the ‘zero’ threshold, particularly in tidal mudflat and wetland vegetation environments, though it did not achieve the accuracy of ‘optimal’ thresholds. These findings highlight the importance of threshold selection and the advantages of sub-pixel waterline extraction for applications requiring precise and consistent shoreline monitoring.",

The individual hazard maps were generated using machine learning models based on the locations of previous occurrences of these hazards and a set of effective environmental factors. The models with the highest accuracies, determined by ROC-AUC values, were selected for each hazard and reclassified into two categories: low-moderate hazard (0) and high-very high hazard (1). These reclassified maps were combined using a Boolean algorithm to generate the final multi-hazard (MH) map. The integrated map reveals that more than one-sixth of the province is free from any of the five hazards, while the majority of the province (five-sixths) is exposed to at least one hazard.",

The positions were rotated to conform to the Vilas & Valencio reconstruction, allowing comparison with the Alcaparrosa pole derived from Late Ordovician magnetism. The joint apparent polar wandering path for Gondwana is extended to the southeastern tip of Australia to incorporate palaeomagnetic data from the Marinoan Glacial beds, as reported by McElhinny & Embleton (1976). The path is consistent with widespread Late Precambrian and Late Ordovician glacial deposits across Africa, suggesting a relationship between polar migration and glaciation events. Notably, the Alcaparrosa pole aligns broadly with Late Ordovician glacial deposits in India and southern Africa, although it does not agree with other Ordovician poles from Gondwanic continents. The palaeomagnetic data support the interpretation that Gondwana existed as a unified supercontinent as far back as 1000 Myr ago, with excellent agreement observed between Cambrian poles from South America, Africa, Australia, India, and Antarctica.

Sandy mud was predominantly found at greater depths in the Baydaratskaya Bay, along the Yamal coast, and extending to the outer estuaries of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. In contrast, muddy sands were observed at shallower depths along the western Yamal Peninsula and into the open sea near the river estuaries. The outer estuaries of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers exhibited diverse sediment types, including mud, sandy mud, and sand, due to significant variations in bottom microrelief. Stations with the coarsest sediments included Stations 5, 10, and 11, while Station 4a appeared visually similar to Station 5. Dense glacial-marine blue-grey mud underlay surface sediments at most stations, except for the sandy stations (4a, 5, and 12). Additionally, large quantities of terrestrial material, such as branches, leaves, and seeds, were observed at stations near the mouths of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers (Stations 6–9 and 12–14).

Elevation gradually varies from lower altitudes in the northeast to higher altitudes in the southwest. Vegetation primarily consists of cool temperate coniferous forests, dominated by larch (Larix gmelini), a late successional coniferous species, interspersed with birch (Betula platyphylla) in xeric sites and open spaces created by fire or harvest. Other species, including Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica), Koyama spruce (Picea koraiensis), willow (Chosenia arbutifolia), aspen (Populus davidiana and P. suaveolens), and dwarf Siberian pine (Pinus pumila), are distributed in smaller areas. Burned patches were manually delineated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from 1990 to 2011, with 111 lightning-caused fires identified during the study period. Patch boundaries were visually determined using false-color composite images of bands 2, 3, and 4, and verified by local fire managers or field inventory when necessary.",

The catchment supports large-scale irrigated agriculture, supplied by major impoundments at Burrinjuck Dam and Blowering Dam.

Maude Weir, one of several gated weirs in the lower Murrumbidgee, is situated upstream of the Lachlan River confluence and downstream of Hay Weir. Observations at Maude Weir pool indicate that thermal stratification, driven by high solar heating and low flow rates, promotes the dominance of the buoyant cyanobacterium *Anabaena circinalis*, which can bloom under persistent stratification conditions, posing risks to livestock and human health. Nutrient availability does not appear to limit *Anabaena* development at this site. Additionally, the NHMM (Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov Model) was fitted to 30 sites across the basin, including Maude and other locations used in the catchment flow prediction model, IQQM, using reliable rainfall data from 1958 to 1967.",

The bathymetry estimates are based on palaeoecological data (Baldi, 1986) and bedform sizes (Sztano, 1994). Along the western coast, the Budafok Sand was deposited in intertidal to shallow subtidal zones, as indicated by molluscan assemblages. This side of the bay featured a steep slope descending towards the central depression, with sedimentary structures such as large-scale composite cross-bedding pointing to dominant southward sand transport. Horizontal bedding with current ripples and mud drapes were also characteristic of this region. At the southernmost tip of the bay, a thick Egerian to Eggenburgian sedimentary succession was deposited, including vertically accreted sand-silt laminites interpreted as intertidal mudflat deposits (Baldi, 1959). \n\nOn the northeastern side of the bay, a gradual deepening and reduction in tidal energy occurred towards the central depression, with smaller dunes and finer-grained sediments interfingering with bathyal siltstones (Sztano and Tari, 1993). The bay's physiography amplified tidal motions due to near-resonance conditions, with dominant sediment transport occurring southward and northward along opposite coasts, driven by topography-induced residual currents and asymmetrical tidal motions (Sztano, 1994). At the mouth of the bay, deep marine silty deposits (Szécseny Schlier) terminate abruptly, with no shallow marine equivalents to the north or east, suggesting the bay extended further northeast. The total length of the bay, from its southernmost tip to the northernmost outcrops, was considerable, with the greatest isopachs of the Schlier exceeding significant thicknesses in the northeastern continuation of the bay.",

Notable features include the Reduno anticline, a downward-facing structure characterized by a near-vertical to overturned southern limb and a strongly overturned northern limb, dipping steeply southward. The northern limb comprises upper Albian–lower Coniacian pre-extensional limestones and the lowermost Maciños calcarenites. This anticline is interpreted as being cored by Keuper evaporites, although these sediments are largely eroded, with remnants observed in the footwall of the Armeña and Seira faults. Additionally, the southern continuation of the Vaquerizal anticline is visible, showing a growth wedge with a significant change in dip of the layers, transitioning into the overturned southern limb of the Reduno anticline.\n\n(b) Interpreted photograph of the Armeña basin, highlighting the stratigraphic and structural relationships. The basin contains wedges of middle Coniacian to early Santonian growth strata that fan toward a partially inverted extensional listric fault at its base. The facies distribution reveals shallow-water Maciños calcarenites concentrated near the fault, grading northward into deeper-water limestones of the Aguasalenz Formation. An isolated outcrop of Keuper evaporites embedded within the Maciños calcarenites is observed near the Raymond d’Espouy peak, supporting the presence of a Keuper diapir during basin development. The Reduno anticline is prominently exposed in the northeast face of the Reduno peak, with its overturned limbs and structural geometry indicative of salt tectonics during inversion.\n\n(c) Detailed view of sedimentary wedges in the Armeña basin, displaying stacked synclines preferentially developed adjacent to the Armeña fault. These wedges exhibit local thinning, upturn, and erosional truncations near the fault, resembling hook geometries typical of passive diapir flanks. The Aguasalenz Formation unconformity, visible in the Raymond d’Espouy peak, separates older strata influenced by salt inflation and diapirism from younger layers shaped by salt withdrawal. The fanning of strata, exceeding 90°, is attributed to a combination of salt tectonics and extension, accentuated by shortening during tectonic inversion.",

(a) During glacial stages, intensified NE monsoon winds increased aridity and evaporation in the northern Red Sea, leading to hypersaline surface waters that sank to form deep water in the Gulf of Suez and northernmost Red Sea. This deep water ventilated benthic ecosystems and flowed southward, exiting the Red Sea. (b) Interglacial periods were characterized by eustatic sea level rise, improved water exchange through the Bab el Mandeb, and reduced surface and deep-water salinities due to increased rainfall and humid conditions driven by intensified SW monsoons and a northward shift of the ITCZ. (c) During glacial stage 6, extreme hypersaline conditions dominated the northern Red Sea due to low sea levels and arid climates, while the southern Red Sea experienced increased humidity from a southward-shifted rainfall border. (d) Around 125–90 Kyr BP, intensified African monsoons and freshwater influx lowered surface salinity, leading to water column stratification, reduced deep-water formation, and oxygen-depleted bottom waters. (e) During later glacial stages, reduced sea levels and intensified NE trade winds enhanced productivity in the southern Red Sea, while deep-water formation in the north was drastically reduced. (f) A combination of glacial sea level lowering and humid climates created a distinct pycnocline, with highly saline deep waters and low-salinity surface waters, resulting in oxygen-depleted conditions at the sea floor. (g) The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was marked by extreme glacial conditions, with sea levels significantly lower than present, drastically reducing water exchange through the Bab el Mandeb. (h) In the late Holocene, arid conditions and high evaporation rates in the northern Red Sea enhanced vertical mixing and deep-water formation, leading to well-ventilated bottom waters. A north–south gradient in oxygenation and productivity is observed, with higher oxygen levels and lower productivity in the north compared to the nutrient-rich southern Red Sea influenced by inflow from the Gulf of Aden. Key processes depicted include vertical mixing, deep-water formation, organic matter fluxes, and convection cells.",

The bathymetric data reveal a 180-meter (100-fathom) depth difference between Bowers Basin and the Aleutian Basin, suggesting that the deeper Bowers Basin may have formed through graben-type faulting. The floor of Bowers Basin is characterized as an abyssal plain, gently sloping from 3826 meters along the traverse, and is geologically similar to the Aleutian Plain, which dips from 3712 meters. Profiler records indicate that the thick, level-bedded sedimentary sections beneath the Bowers abyssal plain are nearly identical to those beneath the Aleutian Plain, implying that turbidity currents responsible for filling the Aleutian Basin also contributed to sediment deposition in Bowers Basin. U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey soundings from 1950, along with unpublished data provided by R. B. Perry and H.

First, the alignment of the Pacific plate movement vector relative to the island arc strike is debated, with some indications suggesting it is normal to the Kuril-Kamchatka island arc strike (Kaizuka 1975). Second, the extrapolated volcanic zone does not align with the active Alaska volcanoes, which are shifted northwest from the extrapolation line. This displacement, referred to as the \"Iliamna line,\" is observed not only for Quaternary volcanoes but also for Mesozoic complexes of the arc's inner part, the axial line of the Cook Bay-Shelikhov Strait inter-arc trough, Mesozoic complexes of the arc's outer zone (e.g., Kodiak Island and Kenai Peninsula), and the axial line of the deep trench. The tectonic nature of the Iliamna line remains unclear, as left-lateral displacement is not consistently observed across all tectonic elements. For example, the Brun Bay fault along the northwest coast of Cook Bay does not exhibit such displacement, with movements along this fault ceasing since the Oligocene (Detterman & Reed 1980).",

The vertical velocity field shows upward motion over the warmer, drier surface and descent on either side. Temperature and humidity panels show a reduction in gradients at the western boundary and an increase at the eastern boundary of the grass, driven by mean westerly advection, which also results in stronger convergence at the eastern boundary where the secondary circulation opposes the mean flow, enhancing ascent.

These terranes are separated by major tectonic sutures, such as the N-S-trending Nabitah (NB) and Idsas (ID) sutures (depicted as double lines). The Idsas suture, also referred to as the Al-Amar or Al-Amar-Idsas suture, marks the collision zone between the Ar-Rayn terrane to the east and the Arabian Shield. The Ar-Rayn terrane consists of immature metasediments, metavolcanics, syntectonic gneisses, and post-tectonic granites, with rock ages ranging from approximately 650 Ma to 2000 Ma. To the west of the Idsas suture lies the Ad-Dawadimi terrane, a 100 km-wide belt of deformed clastics intercalated with ophiolitic rocks, interpreted as an accretionary prism formed in a subduction-related setting. Further west, the Afif terrane is characterized by post-orogenic granites, volcanic rocks, and sediments.\n\nThe Arabian Shield is transected by the NW-trending Najd (NJ) strike-slip fault system, which represents a prominent Late Precambrian to Early Cambrian tectonic feature. This fault system accumulated significant left-lateral displacement and provides evidence of Infracambrian tectonic movement. The Najd fault system may extend across the Red Sea into the Duwi shear zone.

This zonal displacement results in warm anomalies separating the cyclones. The observed flow pattern is influenced by a fast westward jet located just north of the eddies, which intensifies the cyclonic structures while weakening anticyclonic features. On September 18, a large anticyclonic eddy was detected, extending zonally by approximately 200 km and meridionally by 100 km. This eddy propagated westward along the northern boundary of the MP region at a phase speed consistent with linear barotropic Rossby waves, with characteristic orbital velocities of approximately 10 cm/s. The eddy exhibited a well-developed barotropic and baroclinic structure, intensifying with depth, and likely formed in the deep layers due to interactions with meandering jets or bottom topography. The velocity field at this depth also displayed significant temporal variability, with notable changes in flow direction and structure between late August and mid-September, including southeastward and southwestward flows. The maps provide a unique illustration of the complex interactions between baroclinic eddies of varying vertical structures and the dynamic interplay of jets and eddies in the region.",

Mean annual rainfall varies significantly across the basin, ranging from low levels at Walgett in the west to higher amounts near the Great Dividing Range in the southeast. Rainfall is predominantly summer-dominant, often occurring as high-intensity, short-duration thunderstorms that can lead to flooding and significant erosion. Geologically, the basin is bisected by the Hunter-Mooki Thrust System, a major structural lineament trending north-northwest from the catchment boundary south of Nundle to Warialda in the north. East of this fault zone, the basement rocks consist of tightly folded and intensely fractured Ordovician and Silurian metasediments and limestones, overlain by Late Devonian to Carboniferous sediments and intruded by the New England Granitic Batholith. To the west of the fault zone lie the Gunnedah and Oxley-Surat basins, separated by the Jurassic Garrawilla volcanics. The youngest consolidated rocks in the region are the Cenozoic volcanics, which extensively outcrop and define prominent features such as the Nandewar Ranges, Liverpool Ranges, and Warrumbungles. Weathering and erosion of these volcanic formations have contributed to the formation of highly fertile alluvial soils in the Liverpool Plains near Gunnedah.",

The first EOF captures the seasonal cycle, highlighting regions of vigorous convection during local summer, with the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere features peaking in August and February, respectively. The second EOF also reflects seasonal variability, including semiannual harmonics. The third EOF represents interannual variability associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), accounting for a smaller fraction of the variance. The fourth EOF, while dominated by seasonal features, exhibits weak ENSO-related variability. All EOFs shown are statistically significant based on North’s rule of thumb, ensuring robust separation of eigenvalues.

The error variance ratio between observations and the background is 0.05. Observation void areas are shown in grey, and the $1000\\mathrm{m}$ topographic contour is indicated by the heavy line. This analysis highlights the superior performance of the MOLOCH model run, particularly in comparison to the BOLAM model, which is not shown here. Although single precipitation peaks are generally not colocated, the MOLOCH model accurately captures the general precipitation patterns. However, the model tends to overestimate precipitation over and to the north of the Ligurian Apennines. The precipitation in this area is attributed to pre-frontal convective rainfall, which is weak in the BOLAM model, as well as orographic precipitation during the frontal passage and subsequent northeasterly flow.

The input is passed through a 2-dimensional convolutional layer equipped with a filter bank of 20 filters of size [specific size not provided], which extracts spatial features from the image patches. This is followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation layer to introduce non-linearity. Subsequently, a Max Pooling layer with a rectangular window size of [specific size not provided] and a stride size of 2 is applied to reduce spatial dimensions while retaining critical features. The pooled activations are then fed into a Fully Connected (FC) layer with an output size of six, corresponding to the six visual feature classes under assessment. Finally, the activations from the FC layer are processed by a Softmax layer, which computes the class probabilities for the visual feature classification task.",

The data have been collocated and averaged to the TMI field-of-view to eliminate sampling biases. The rainfall values shown are conditional on the presence of rain, representing mean rain rates where rainfall is detected. Overall, the TMI retrievals produce globally higher rainfall estimates compared to the PR, a well-documented bias attributed to differences in retrieval methodologies. However, significant regional variations in the bias are evident. Over land, the TMI estimates are more variable and tend to rely on the scattering signature of precipitation-sized ice particles, while over the ocean, where the TMI retrievals are more physically based, the PR occasionally produces higher rainfall estimates, such as in regions east of Japan and the North Atlantic. The bias map (panel c) highlights these regional differences, with light blue areas indicating regions where the PR estimates exceed those of the TMI, particularly in areas of relatively low rainfall due to the PR's higher spatial resolution and ability to detect smaller, isolated rainfall systems. Variations along the Pacific ITCZ are also observed, though they are smaller compared to other regions. These results underscore the importance of understanding regional differences in rainfall retrievals and the influence of algorithmic assumptions on global and regional rainfall estimates.**",

The seasonal maps highlight that the HANTS reconstruction generally achieves lower RMSE values during seasons with reduced cloud cover, such as summer (JJA), particularly over regions like Eurasia. During these periods, a slightly higher number of harmonics can be utilized for reconstruction, as evidenced by the temperate vegetation areas in summer. Seasonal variations in the optimal number of harmonics are observed across most regions, although RMSE values remain above 0.02 in many areas, except for temperate vegetation during summer. These results emphasize the influence of seasonal cloud cover and vegetation dynamics on the reconstruction performance of the HANTS method.",

As this stream progresses, it entrains warm water from Ross Bay, which is drying during the ebb tide, and then splits into two branches upon encountering Ross Island.

A massive landslide triggered by snowmelt during the spring thaw of 2013 in Northeast Iceland.** The event was caused by shear failures in the soil, which were exacerbated by the unique properties of Icelandic soils. These soils, often thixotropic in nature, can reach their liquid limit upon disturbance at high water contents, even though they may appear cohesive beforehand. During the thaw, some parts of the soil surface remained frozen, leading to the buildup of high pressures within the soil. This pressure, combined with the saturation of the soil, caused rapid flow of the material downslope. The thixotropic behavior of the soils, characterized by their ability to lose cohesion and flow when disturbed, played a critical role in the landslide dynamics. Such events are common in Iceland due to the unique water-holding characteristics and structural properties of Andosols, which are highly susceptible to erosion and instability under saturated conditions.",

Three major thrust nappe belts—Qingchuan, Beichuan, and Majiaoba—developed sequentially from west to east, forming a high-relief region along the western basin boundary established during the Indosinian. Numerous large to medium-sized faults and inversion structures emerged within these thrust nappe belts, contributing to the intricate structural configuration. Early faults formed during the Indosinian movement were further developed during the Yanshanian and Himalayan periods, though the Lower and Middle Triassic gypsum rocks remained unpenetrated, as evidenced by seismic and drilling data. The back thrust anticlinal belt at the footwall of Hidden Fault I evolved atop the Tianjingshan palaeouplift, creating a prominent anticlinorium high zone. This tectonic unit, bounded by stratigraphic pinch-outs, lithologic interfaces, and hidden faults, formed a large closed system with excellent sealing properties, enabling the re-accumulation of natural gas in the Upper Paleozoic strata to form gas reservoirs.",

A fan-shaped cavity is observed, characterized by sloped sides and an arched ceiling formed above the opening. This cavity expands as cycles of water inflow and outflow continue. The saturated soil surrounding the cavity becomes prone to collapse, with soil on the lower side of the cavity sliding along the side slopes. In contrast, the soil above the cavity remains partially unsaturated unless the water level rises to the top of the cavity during the water inflow stage. In this state, apparent cohesion due to suction and particle interlocking contributes to the formation of a ground arching effect near the cavity ceiling. The deformation pattern in the disturbed zone is influenced not only by the relationship between suction and the degree of saturation but also by the outflow of fine particles, which leads to increased looseness prior to cavity formation.",

The Phase I reclamation contract, awarded in mid-2000, involved the formation of 200 hectares of land through predominantly dredged reclamation. At the northern end of the site, soft marine mud was left in place and treated using vertical band drains installed from land after the placement of reclamation fill. Subsequent infrastructure construction contracts, awarded in October 2001, included additional ground treatment works to meet stringent settlement criteria required for the high-priority land formation and infrastructure development. To accelerate consolidation and achieve the stipulated residual settlement criteria within the limited construction period, stone columns were installed in specific areas, including the footprint of the main approach road to the Theme Park and areas north of the vertical band drain-treated zones. These stone columns acted as large-diameter drainage wells and contributed to minimizing settlements and differential settlements by transferring loads to firmer strata beneath the soft mud.",

On the inner shelf, modern sediments of varying thickness cover the irregular surface of the acoustic basement. In the mid-shelf region, seaward-dipping sedimentary sequences are observed, with relatively gentle dips that steepen near and beneath the central trough. The Uniboom profile (A–A′) reveals the central trough region, where limited acoustic penetration prevents clear identification of internal structures deeper than approximately 50 meters below the seafloor. In the northwestern part of the trough, hyperbolic reflections are observed at depths of about 40 meters below the seafloor, while in the southeastern part, a well-layered, mound-shaped deposit overlies the erosional surface of the sedimentary strata. This deposit, with a maximum thickness of approximately 20 meters, exhibits a sigmoidal reflection pattern indicative of sediment progradation. The erosional surface of the sedimentary strata, irregular in relief, suggests truncation during periods of low sea level. In the mid-shelf region, this surface is covered by a thin veneer (approximately 1–2 meters) of gravelly sand or sand. Gravel-sized clasts, likely transported through a paleochannel system extending across the mid-shelf, are concentrated at water depths of about 100 meters, indicating sediment transport from the Korean Peninsula. The vertical axis of the Uniboom profile is presented in two-way travel time (ms).",

The gorge extends from the village of Dolac to the village of Prosek and is characterized by its composite, grandiose, and heterogeneous landscape. It features two narrow sections primarily composed of carbonate rocks and an expansion at the mouth of the Ostrovički Creek. The lower gorge was formed in Permian and Devonian sandstones, while the upstream section consists of Jurassic carbonate rocks, including stratified and banked limestone and dolomites. One of the most remarkable features of the gorge is the Gradištanski Canyon, a 7-km-long section with nearly vertical, closely folded sides reaching heights of up to 90° and widths as narrow as a few meters. The canyon was formed in Cretaceous stratified limestone and dolomites. The area is rich in caves and rock shelters, including the Svinjska Rupa Cave, Ogorelička Cave, Šuplja Dupka Cave, and Mala Balanica Cave, the latter being a significant paleoanthropological site where Middle Pleistocene human dentition was discovered. The gorge also features pits, sinkholes, hummocks, terraced stone cliffs, and imposing limestone escarpments. Covering an area of 7,746 hectares, the Sićevačka Gorge was first protected in 1977 and officially declared a Nature Park in 2000. (Photo: Jovana Mladenović)",

The compressional model exhibits very low standard deviation in the upper mantle, attributed to its constraint as a scaled version of the shear model in this region. Areas of larger error are predominantly located in the eastern Pacific within the mid-mantle and the Southern Hemisphere in the lowermost mantle, reflecting limited coverage caused by source–receiver geometry. In the shear velocity model, error increases just above the transition zone due to reduced sensitivity of surface waves at greater depths, despite longer-period surface waves providing some sensitivity into the transition zone.

In 1999, the lake's surface elevation was lower than the apparent water table along a portion of the watershed perimeter, and by 2009, this percentage had increased further, reflecting a deepening depression of the lake surface relative to its surroundings. This depression can be quantified in terms of potential groundwater fluxes, with the ratio of potential outward to inward fluxes decreasing significantly from 1999 to 2009, suggesting a diminished potential for net groundwater outflow. (c) Modeled scenarios of Twelvemile Lake surface elevation under varying permafrost-table depths (parameterized by \\( h_{src} \\)) and assuming a hydraulic conductivity (\\( K_{gw} \\)) of \\( 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1} \\) show that, in the absence of permafrost, groundwater inflow from the direction of Buddy Lake would result in a steady-state elevation with a water-surface gradient of approximately 0.001. Higher hydraulic conductivity values would produce even lower gradients. These findings suggest that permafrost inhibits shallow groundwater flow, maintaining the observed steep water table gradient and contributing to the hydrological isolation of Twelvemile Lake.",

A comparison of SGD at the same seawater depth reveals that SGD near the river mouth (location C) is smaller than that farther from the river mouth (location B).

The lower Miocene sand-bearing package is thickest within the hangingwall syncline and thins rapidly eastward onto the crest of the monocline, indicating significant seabed topography during deposition. This thinning pattern suggests that turbidity currents were channeled into the hangingwall syncline depressions, influenced by the structural flexure generated at the tip of Fault 1 during its early propagation stages. Subsequent fault propagation through the flexure isolated portions of the lower sand unit in the footwall, while stratigraphic thickening of overlying lower Miocene sediments occurred in the hangingwall. Exploration drilling confirms sedimentary thinning onto the monocline crest and provides direct evidence of the structural control exerted by the fault system on turbidite deposition.",

The visible \"area\" of the colony in each photograph was measured relative to the same colony in different years using Adobe Photoshop CS6. The outlined colony perimeter was measured multiple times to account for measurement errors associated with lens distortion and photographer positioning. Relative area changes were calculated in arbitrary units by setting a custom scale based on the distance between two stationary boulders visible in the photographs. Despite the complexity of the colony's topography and the oblique angle of the photographs, this approach allowed for a comparison of colony size across the time series. These measurements show that, while most colonies continued to decline from 1984 to 1996, the Dragon colony experienced significant growth in area by 2012.

Counties are categorized to highlight areas where modeled cropland exceeded historical maximums. Black-shaded counties represent areas where the historical maximum cropland extent was already surpassed by more than 25 km² at the start of the simulation period, reflecting inconsistencies between the starting land-use/land-cover (LULC) datasets and the Agricultural Census data. Magenta-shaded counties indicate areas where cropland initially remained below historical maximums but exceeded them by more than 25 km² by 2050 due to model projections. \n\nThe FORESCE model under the A1B and A2 scenarios projected significant cropland expansion, particularly in the Great Plains, leading to numerous counties surpassing historical maximums by 2050. The NRI Econometric Model's \"high cropland\" scenario also projected increases in cropland, with several counties in the southwestern United States and Texas exceeding historical maximums, even in scenarios predicting overall cropland loss. In contrast, the FS-RPA scenarios showed modest cropland declines, resulting in no counties surpassing historical maximums by 2050. Among the RCP scenarios, only RCP 2.6 projected notable cropland increases, primarily in the western United States, causing many counties to exceed historical maximums. Similarly, GCAM scenarios showed significant cropland gains in the western United States, with many counties surpassing historical maximums by 2050, despite some counties already exceeding these levels at the start of the simulation period.\n\nThis analysis underscores the influence of thematic differences and starting LULC datasets on model outcomes, as well as the potential for cropland expansion to surpass historical maxima under certain economic and technological conditions. However, it also highlights the biophysical and economic constraints on cropland expansion, particularly in arid regions like the interior West, which are poorly suited for traditional or second-generation biofuel crops.",

Within this shear zone, Area 1 is marked as a small lenticular basin where 47 cores were drilled at four localities in red sandstones and sandy conglomerates of the Daling Formation. Additionally, ten cores were drilled at locality L28 southwest of Area 1, which contains vertically dipping sandstone beds within the fault zone, potentially dating to the Early Jurassic. Paralleling the Permo-Triassic intrusion on its northwest side is the Shiwandashan basin, where Area 2 is located. In this basin, 31 cores were drilled at three localities in the Wangmen Formation, which consists of purple-red siltstones and sandstones and bears Early Jurassic plant fossils such as *Otozamites* sp., *Lycopodiumsporites* sp., *Classopollos* sp., and *C. classoides*. The map also includes Late Cretaceous sample locality L107, which lies near Area 1 and is separated by a fault from the Early Jurassic strata in Area 2.

Liatarnet, the highest mountain south of Blomvåg (marked \"Lia\"), was investigated for erratic boulders, yielding exposure ages that suggest it may have been a nunatak during the initial deglaciation. The Agotnes site on Sotra Island revealed marine sediments from the Allerød-Younger Dryas transition, with shell samples dated to 14.2–14.1 cal. ka BP, indicating ice-free conditions prior to the Younger Dryas readvance.

For the shallower ice shelves, such as the Eastern Weddell Ice Shelf (EWIS) and Larsen Ice Shelf, refreezing is generally minimal, with enhanced melting occurring predominantly near the ice fronts. In contrast, the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) exhibits pronounced basal melting near the grounding lines of several ice streams, south of Berkner Island, and near the eastern Ronne ice front, with peak melt rates exceeding 7 meters water equivalent per year (m.w.e./yr). Refreezing under FRIS is significant, occurring north of the Korff and Henry ice rises, under central Ronne, and along the western margins of the Filchner and Ronne Troughs. The inclusion of tidal effects intensifies both melting and freezing, particularly under central Ronne for freezing and in the central and eastern Ronne and Filchner Troughs for melting. Tides also slightly expand the spatial extent of refreezing regions, such as the patch north of the central Ronne ice rises. These simulated patterns of basal melting and refreezing align well with observational estimates, though some discrepancies exist, such as the extent of refreezing near the western margin of Ronne.

This results in an over-representation of riparian woodland pollen grains, such as *Alnus* and *Salix*, in sediments near the Rhone River.

The Eaton method, widely used for calibrating pore pressure with sonic slowness, was applied across various fields in this region. The Eaton coefficient, which varies between 1 and 2.5 depending on proximity to the littoral or offshore areas, was calibrated and mapped to serve as a reference for future calibration efforts. This map provides a foundational tool for understanding pore pressure distribution and identifying overpressure zones, which are influenced by unloading mechanisms in certain formations. Notable examples include shale domes in the Macuspana basin, which induce abnormal pressures in the upper and lower Pliocene, and sands in the upper Miocene of the Bellota-Chinchorro-Palangre-Bricol-Yagual basin, which also exhibit unloading effects.",

The GPS surface profile reveals prominent undulations between specific distances along the traverse, which correspond to topographic features visible in Radarsat imagery. Notably, a trough at one location appears as a distinct dark line oriented transverse to the flow direction, while subsequent depressions are visible as less pronounced brightness variations. The surface traverse route intersects these features at an oblique angle. A comparison between GPS and DEM profiles shows good agreement in smoother sections of the segment, but the DEM fails to capture the undulations in the ice stream onset region, with elevation differences reaching significant values. Smoothing the GPS profile improves agreement with the DEM, suggesting the DEM's horizontal resolution is coarser than previously estimated, which has implications for mapping features associated with enhanced ice flow.",

Yield values are lowest in the lower right region of the area, a trend consistent with soil fertility characteristics observed in the same region. This pattern aligns with the spatial behavior of soil properties such as silt, coarse sand, organic matter (OM), pH, calcium (Ca), sum of bases, and macroporosity, which influence aeration and reduce soil compaction. In contrast, maps for other soil properties, including phosphorus (P), clay, and fine sand, exhibit different spatial trends compared to yield distribution.

Panels (a) and (b) show 500-hPa height anomalies (gpm) for SVD mode 1 and mode 2, respectively, while panels (c) and (d) depict 850-hPa wind anomalies (vectors, m s⁻¹) and 925-hPa divergence anomalies (contours, s⁻¹) for the same modes. In panels (c) and (d), contour intervals are 2.0 × 10⁻⁷ s⁻¹, with positive values shown in red, negative values in blue, and the zero contour in thick black. Shading in panels (c) and (d) corresponds to the height anomalies in panels (a) and (b).\n\nFor SVD mode 1 (panels a and c), the 500-hPa height anomalies exhibit a Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern characterized by an anomalous high over the North Pacific, a low over Canada, and another high over southern U.S. and northern Mexico. This wave train originates from the tropical Pacific in response to La Niña conditions. Over Central America (CAM), positive height anomalies to the north and negative anomalies to the south are dynamically consistent with low-level divergent and convergent flows, respectively, which align with precipitation patterns in the region. Additionally, La Niña is associated with a strong easterly Caribbean low-level jet, which enhances precipitation in CAM.\n\nFor SVD mode 2 (panels b and d), the 500-hPa height field is dominated by positive anomalies in the tropics, consistent with general warming of tropical SSTs. A weaker wave train is observed over the PNA region compared to mode 1. Over CAM, positive height anomalies downstream favor dry conditions, likely driven by warm SST anomalies in adjacent oceans. Two centers of 925-hPa divergence coincide with precipitation deficits in CAM, while 850-hPa northwesterly wind anomalies in the Caribbean Sea suppress the local low-level jet, contributing to reduced precipitation in the region. These circulation anomalies highlight the atmospheric processes linking tropical SST variability to CAM precipitation through the two SVD modes.",

In both cases, the strongest vertical motion occurs in the atmospheric layers between the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), with a maximum intensity observed at altitudes between 400 hPa and 500 hPa. \n\nIn the wet-dipole composite, a pronounced core of vertical motion spans approximately 10° of latitude at mid-levels and extends over a similar range in the boundary layer, indicating strong coupling between surface and mid-level dynamics. The maximum vertical motion is located near 400 hPa in the upper atmosphere and shifts closer to the surface at lower altitudes. Additionally, a subsidence maximum is observed near the Equator. \n\nIn contrast, the dry-dipole composite exhibits vertical motion of comparable magnitude but confined to a narrower latitudinal range of approximately 5°. Near the surface, upward motion is observed north of the Equator, while subsidence dominates to the south. \n\nAn additional feature in the wet-dipole composite is the merging of a low-level core of vertical motion over the western Sahara with the extensive vertical motion maximum over the Sahel. This low-level core, associated with the heat low over the western Sahara, is confined to the lower atmosphere, with ascent strongest between 850 hPa and 700 hPa. In the dry-dipole composite, this secondary convective maximum is absent, although vertical motion over the western Sahara remains relatively strong.",

The major tributaries of the Dibru river include the Dum Duma, Dhola, and Dangori rivers. The annular drainage pattern observed in the basin, particularly around Dum Duma-Baghjan, is attributed to a domal upwarp structure located at the central part of the basin. This structural feature is further supported by the presence of a prominent magnetic high near Dum Duma. The alignment of the east-west seismic section, shown in the map, highlights the tectonic activity in the region, including a significant upwarp and an important fault in the basement near Baghjan.

Each turbine employs advanced aerodynamic and mechanical designs to efficiently convert wind energy into electricity. The MOD-2 turbines utilize horizontal-axis configurations with three-blade rotors, a design that optimizes lift forces for energy generation. These turbines are grid-connected and exemplify the growing adoption of wind energy for utility-scale applications during the early 1980s.

For Z03, located above the leachate level, the resistivity ranged widely, with very low-resistivity zones distributed across all four sides of the waste pile. These low-resistivity zones are similar to those observed in the waste pile at field capacity. The total area of these very low-resistivity zones decreased, while the very high-resistivity zones increased from ET-1 to ET-2, likely due to gas generation and migration within the waste layer from the mature leachate recirculation process. For Z04, Z09, and Z10, located below the leachate level, the resistivity also spanned a wide range, with approximately half of the data set showing resistivity values below a threshold. Notably, several high-resistivity zones were identified in the waste layer below the leachate level. These zones could be attributed to the presence of high-resistivity materials, such as plastic, rubber, and cinder, or the accumulation of landfill gas, which is a good electrical insulator under landfill temperature and pressure conditions. Given that the resistivity of saturated waste components in similar conditions is typically lower, the accumulation of landfill gas is considered the most likely cause for the observed resistivity in these zones, indicating a partially saturated waste layer below the leachate level. Similar high-resistivity zones induced by landfill gas accumulation have been reported in various landfills, such as at the Filborna landfill in Sweden and the Rainham landfill in the UK. The resistivity profiles in this study are consistent with these observations, supporting the conclusion that the high-resistivity zones in the underwater waste layer are likely due to landfill gas accumulation.",

Fire refugia were defined as areas within the very low/unchanged burn severity class, representing pixels with ≥90% estimated tree survival within the first year post-fire. These areas include both unburned and lightly burned conditions that experienced less severe fire effects compared to the rest of the burned landscape. Non-forest areas were distinguished using ancillary spatial datasets, and accounted for 31% of the total refugia extent across all fires and 10% of the refugia extent within the Table Mountain Complex. The spatial distribution of refugia varied widely, with non-forest conditions being more prevalent in certain refugia areas, as illustrated in zoomed-in maps.

Synthetic faulting, with faults dipping away from the border fault complexes, contributes to the shoaling of these units. The South Basin corresponds to a single half-graben unit and is separated from the Turkwel Basin by a structural high that has undergone repeated subaerial exposure and erosion. The Turkwel Basin is a down-to-the-west half-graben dominated by eastward-dipping synthetic faults, with reflectors diverging westward, indicating prolonged subsidence. The Kataboi Half-graben is down-dropped to the west and characterized by significant eastward-dipping faults, while the Koobi Fora Half-graben, a down-to-the-east structure, is distorted by a large volcanic cone associated with North Island. The Omo Half-graben, the most subsided structural unit, exhibits sediment accumulation exceeding 3.5 seconds of two-way travel time in the northwest portion of the lake.

Slight modification (index values 1a, 1b, 2, 3a, 3b) is predominant in only five landscapes, primarily in areas such as the Serpukhov region, the Oka Terrace nature preserve, and interfluves of the Nara, Pakhra, Desna, and Mocha rivers. Moderate modification (index values 4–10) is observed in 35 landscapes, including the Smolensk-Moscow Upland and the Moskva-Oka interfluve. Intensive modification (index values 11–19) is prevalent in 37 landscapes, particularly in the Upper Volga region, the Meshchera Lowland, and higher elevations of the Smolensk-Moscow Upland. \n\nThe map also highlights varying levels of human pressure. Slight pressure is currently observed in only four landscapes, while a combination of slight and moderate pressure is present in eight landscapes, including the Dubna Lowland and areas near the Istra Reservoir. Moderate pressure dominates in 23 landscapes, often combined with intensive pressure in 16 of them, particularly in the Smolensk-Moscow Upland, the Moskva-Oka lowland, and the Klin-Dmitrov Ridge. Intensive pressure is associated with activities such as fertilizer application, livestock grazing, industrial and municipal pollution, and irrigation.\n\nThis map serves as a critical tool for understanding the spatial distribution of human impacts on natural territorial complexes (NTCs) and provides a foundation for recommending measures to mitigate human-induced pressures and protect the natural environment of Moscow Oblast.",

As the instability evolves, individual wave crests overturn and break, forming turbulent cores that concentrate the vorticity of the initial shear layer. This phase of the evolution is characterized by intense turbulence, which causes rapid mixing of air and generates large gradients in density and radar refractivity. These gradients produce zones of high radar reflectivity, observed as strongly stratified braided structures between adjacent billows. The resulting pattern resembles a \"cat's-eye\" structure, indicative of the turbulent mixing and stratification surrounding the well-mixed billow cores. This radar reflectivity cross-section, originally obtained by Gossard et al. [1971], provides a clear depiction of the initial stages of KH instability evolution.

The water table contours for sections AB and XY were analyzed to assess the relationship between groundwater potential zones and water level conditions. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the two, with 'good' groundwater potential zones aligning with shallow to moderate water levels, 'moderate' zones corresponding to medium water levels, and 'poor' zones associated with deep to very deep water levels. These variations in groundwater depth are influenced by hydrogeological conditions, spatial differences in recharge rates, and topographical features.

Prominent rainfall features, such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), are clearly visible. The annual rainfall estimates over oceanic regions, after applying a beam-filling correction factor of 1.5, are 1444 mm yr⁻¹ for the morning passes and slightly lower for the evening passes. The ratio of morning to evening rainfall estimates is approximately 1.22, consistent with previous studies reporting similar ratios (e.g., Sharma et al., 1991; Petty and Katsaros, 1992).

The RCM simulations capture the orographic features of the region, showing a spatial pattern similar to the observations. However, notable differences are evident in the magnitude and location of maximum RX1D values. The RCM simulations depict the highest RX1D values over the northwestern region, whereas observations indicate maximum values along the central Mediterranean coast. This discrepancy is attributed to the Mediterranean coast's annual rainfall being dominated by a few days of intense precipitation.

The counterclockwise gyre aligns with the prevailing northward winds and southward coastal flows, which contribute to flow separation and recirculation at the upstream headland, specifically Point Teatinos. The observed circulation pattern is consistent with theoretical models and prior studies, including those of Hickey et al. (2003) and Gan et al. (1995, 1997), which attribute this flow behavior to coastal forcing and internal radii of deformation. The size of the gyre, approximately equal to the internal radius of deformation, is indicated in the figure, supporting the notion that centrifugal accelerations around coastal points, such as Point Teatinos, play a significant role in the development of these circulations.",

This earthquake, with a moment magnitude of 8.1, is notable as the largest recorded oceanic intraplate earthquake, occurring away from any plate boundary. The P-axis orientation of the main event is NE-SW, contrasting with the NW-SE P-axis orientation typical of strike-slip events along nearby transform faults on the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR). Aftershock locations suggest rupture likely occurred on an E-W trending fault plane, nearly perpendicular to pre-existing fracture zones.

Dense microbubble clouds near the towfish zenith contribute to the backscatter, with lower densities observed farther across-track.  \n*(d)* **Horizontal volume acoustic backscattering strength ($S_V$):** The image formed in the vertical plane $47~\\mathrm{m}$ to the right of the TVSS shows volume scattering layers influenced by zooplankton aggregations. Zooplankton density decreases with depth from the mixed layer through the upper and lower thermocline, resulting in reduced mean backscattering strength and increased skewness, kurtosis, and scintillation index. Sparse distributions of small fish near the bottom and surface reverberation after the first echo arrival also contribute to the backscatter.  \n\nCorrupted data regions, including across-track lines at $Y=120~\\mathrm{m}$ and $Y=235~\\mathrm{m}$ in *(b)* and vertical lines at the same along-track locations in *(c)*, were excluded from the analysis.",

Positive height anomalies are observed over the subtropical North Pacific and Northwest Canada, while negative anomalies are present over the AL region and southeastern North America. These anomalies form a Pacific–North American (PNA) wave train, suggesting that the PNA pattern strongly influences the winter AL intensity. The anomalous high over the subtropics and the anomalous low over the AL region enhance the height gradient, accelerating the westerly jet at 500 hPa. The AL, located to the left of the jet exit where divergence occurs, experiences pressure decreases at lower levels, leading to its intensification.  \n(b) The correlation map for SLP shows statistically significant shaded regions. Positive correlations are evident over the Arctic and the Asian continent, while negative correlations dominate the mid-high latitudes of Europe, North America, and the North Pacific. This out-of-phase correlation pattern between the Arctic and the mid-high latitudes resembles the Arctic Oscillation (AO) pattern, suggesting that AO variability may influence the winter AL intensity.

Notably, regions such as Hudson Bay, central United States, Australia, the Sahel, Pakistan/northwest India, and northeastern China experienced significant changes in high flows. The Hudson Bay area exhibited a widespread increase in high flow percentiles, suggesting enhanced soil moisture levels due to SMOS data assimilation, which subsequently increased both low and high flows. In the central United States, peak flows increased in rivers, aligning with streamflow skill assessments. In Australia, contrasting effects were observed, with increased high flows in the northern fringe and decreased flows in parts of the Murray–Darling basin. The study also found that areas with open land cover, such as grasslands and croplands, showed the greatest impact on high flows, while forested and urban areas were less affected due to measurement interference. Overall, the assimilation of SMOS soil moisture data predominantly influenced high flows, with minimal impact on low flows, likely due to its effect on the top soil layer, which plays a crucial role in surface runoff generation.",

In this model, the NAFZ forms a releasing double bend between segments S-1, S-2, and S-3, with a small stepover and divergence angle between S-1 and S-2 driving the westward pull-apart opening of the basin. The southwestern margin fault (S-1a) is considered part of the NAFZ, and the eastward widening of the basin is attributed to the left-lateral motion of the Ovacık Fault, which is younger than the NAFZ and remains active.  \n(d) Triple junction model by Westaway and Arger [16], interpreting the Erzincan Basin as a triple junction where faults converge across a zone of distributed extension south of the NAFZ (ABC) and west of the Malatya–Ovacık Fault Zone (MOFZ) (DEF). This zone accommodates biaxial extension parallel to both the NAFZ and MOFZ, with faults BC and EF acting as transform faults.  \n(e) New tectonic evolution model for the Erzincan Basin.

Stage 2: Development of the NAFZ and Ovacık Fault, leading to the westward widening of the pull-apart basin between two active NAFZ segments.

The hydrodynamic and sediment transport grid, FLOW, spanned an 11 × 26 km area with 25-m grid cells and was two-way coupled with the SWAN grids. SWAN1 passed wave information (significant wave height, peak period, and dominant direction) to the outer boundaries of SWAN2, a nested 6 × 15 km grid with 25-m grid cells centered on the apex of the headlands.

Each headland rose vertically from the seafloor to an elevation of +15 m at the shoreline, forming a vertical cliff. A shoaling zone approximately 1 km wide was constructed adjacent to the headland, sloping from 0 to 20 m and wrapping around the headland to smoothly connect with upstream and downstream bathymetry.  \n\n(C) Cross-shore profiles at the apex of the headlands illustrate the protrusion of the larger headlands (T7 and T8) farther into the flow field compared to the smaller headlands (T1 and T6).",

The comparison between FLEXPART–NorESM/CAM and NorESM shows that the tracer fields produced by the two models are highly similar, with differences being even smaller than those observed in the ALP case. This indicates that deviations in the results are primarily due to differences in model parameterizations, while the transformation of vertical velocity has a comparatively minor impact.

The ESCT is composed of Precambrian metamorphic blocks, including the Xingxingxia and Tianhu groups, which are overlain by unmetamorphosed Paleozoic and Mesozoic clastic sedimentary strata. Sampling sites are located in Kumishi, south to Dikar, and Weiya within the ESCT. The collected rock types include biotite schist, biotite quartz schist, and gneiss, which exhibit porphyritic fine-grained lepidoblastic and lepidogranoblastic textures, along with porphyroblasts displaying diablastic and helicitic textures. These rocks predominantly feature schistose structures, with localized gneissic structures. Diagnostic metamorphic minerals include garnet, kyanite, staurolite, cordierite (south to Dikar), and andalusite (Weiya), with a matrix composed of biotite, quartz, plagioclase, and occasional K-feldspar, muscovite, and retrograde metamorphic chlorite. Mineral assemblages and textures indicate at least two metamorphic stages: an early stage characterized by garnet, kyanite, and staurolite assemblages formed under relatively high-pressure conditions, and a late stage marked by cordierite and andalusite assemblages formed under high-temperature, low-pressure conditions. These features provide insights into the deformation and metamorphic history of the ESCT.",

The analysis revealed a decline in the number of actively surging glaciers over time, with 18 glaciers surging in the mid-1930s, 10 around 1970, and only 5 in 1990.

Stratal terminations such as truncation, downlap, and internal convergence are also depicted. The upper horizon, characterized by its high amplitude, marks the sediment-water interface and occasionally merges with the middle horizon across deeper channels and parts of the outer shelf. The asymmetry of flow-parallel tidal sand ridges is evident, with the sinuous bar-crest mobile sand frequently offset from the geomorphic center, typically situated nearer the more steeply dipping, eroded flank. This asymmetry is attributed to the interplay of flood- and ebb-dominated currents along the barform.",

The Niyodo River, originating from mountainous regions with high sediment yield, delivers substantial sediment to the coast, contributing to the formation of a fluvial lowland and a river-mouth delta. This delta is characterized by sediment deposition near the river’s mouth, which causes the shoreline to advance. Concurrently, wave action generates longshore sand transport, moving sediment away from the river’s mouth along the coastline. The bathymetry reflects these dynamic processes, showing the interplay between sediment deposition and redistribution. If sediment supply from the river decreases significantly, the protruding delta may erode, and the shoreline could retreat to align perpendicularly to the prevailing wave direction. This map provides a snapshot of the coastal and underwater morphology influenced by these natural processes as of 1988.",

Despite the weak restoring coefficient, which results in ensemble mean SSTs being lower than the targeted SSTs, the interannual variance of modeled SSTs averaged over the North Atlantic is reduced by a factor of 10 compared to free preindustrial control experiments. Regional heterogeneities in SST variance reduction are noted, with stronger effects in the subpolar gyre compared to the tropical Atlantic.

The reduction in excess ozone is most pronounced in regions with the highest nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) concentrations, highlighting the interaction between VOC and NOₓ in ozone formation. Notably, the reduction of anthropogenic VOC emissions appears to be more effective in mitigating excess ozone in most areas of the domain, excluding the southern regions, compared to a corresponding reduction in NOₓ emissions. This suggests that targeting VOC emissions may yield greater benefits in certain regions for controlling ozone pollution.",

This fault extends upward before leveling out to form the top of the intrusion. The sandstone and shale beds of the Morrison Formation, which are well-bedded and resistant, approach the intrusion with a gentle northward dip but bend sharply upward along the vertical fault contact. Near the top of the intrusion, these beds transition from a gentle dip to nearly vertical over a short distance. Three sills extend outward from the intrusion into the Morrison Formation. The lowest sill is entirely concordant and thins gradually along its length, terminating bluntly. The upper two sills are slightly discordant near the intrusion, cutting across the upturned sandstone beds adjacent to the vertical fault. These sills also thin gradually and terminate bluntly. Joints within the intrusion and sills reflect the geometry of the contacts, with vertical joints near horizontal contacts and radiating joints near blunt terminations. The intrusion's thickening appears to have lifted its overburden along the vertical fault, contributing to the deformation of the surrounding rock layers.",

The figure includes a histogram displaying the frequency distribution of classified pixels across eight distinct goal types, as well as a spatial view of the project area. The classification process was conducted at the pixel level using a rule-based decision model, which incorporated factors such as slope steepness, proximity to forest roads, settlements, and rocks, as well as site and stand characteristics like soil type and site index class. Each pixel was evaluated based on its relevance to specific management objectives, such as timber production, recreation, protection against rockfall, water production, and conservation of biodiversity. Forest stands were assigned particular objectives if a majority of their pixels were classified for that objective. The histogram highlights the complexity of silvicultural planning by showcasing the frequency of goal types with overlapping stand-level objectives, emphasizing the challenges in determining suitable future species mixtures and silvicultural interventions.",

This region is characterized by an Atlantic climate with high annual precipitation (1531 mm/year), primarily occurring from autumn to spring, and mean monthly temperatures ranging from 3.5 °C to 17.2 °C. The terrain features steep slopes, which, combined with heavy rainfall, promote significant soil erosion. Montalegre's agricultural system is dominated by permanent semi-natural meadows (lameiros) and common lands, representing around 70% of the agricultural area, with bovine livestock as the primary activity. According to climate classifications, Montalegre falls under the temperate group Csb (Köppen classification) with dry summers and Thornthwaite’s super-humid classification (hydric index: 137; thermal efficiency index: 622 mm evapotranspiration). In contrast, Alentejo, located in the southern region of Portugal, is a dry and flat area within the municipality of Moura, Beja District. This protected zone, known as Herdade da Contenda (HC), covers an area of 52.7 km² along 19 km of the Portuguese-Spanish border, with elevation values ranging from 246 m to 543 m. The region experiences an annual average temperature of 17.0 °C (maximum 24.3 °C, minimum 9.3 °C) and mean annual precipitation of 729.5 mm, with the highest rainfall occurring in January and February and very low precipitation during summer.

This splay fault outcrops on the continental slope seaward of Middleton Island and is supported by seismic reflections and a prominent fault scarp observed on the sea floor [Liberty et al., 2014]. During the 1964 Alaska earthquake, rupture occurred on both the megathrust and the splay fault beneath Middleton Island, resulting in coseismic uplift of the island. The splay fault is hypothesized to bypass the megathrust near its seaward end, shunting slip to the surface during great earthquakes and serving as an efficient source for tsunami generation. Continuous slip on the splay fault at approximately the plate convergence rate has been proposed to explain velocity anomalies, localized uplift, and tilting observed at Middleton Island [Savage et al., 2014]. However, the slip rate on the splay fault appears to be decreasing, consistent with postseismic relaxation. The Patton Bay Fault, another structural feature, outcrops on Montague Island.

Key improvements included the lowering of the watershed pool between 1882 and 1885 and the construction of several dams to enhance water supply. These dams were strategically placed on the Uloma River at its source from Lake Zaulomskoe, on the Shosha River connecting Lake Melekhovskoe with Lake Vazerinskoe, and on smaller rivers linking Lakes Konstantinovskoe and Doigoe. Additionally, mill dams were installed to regulate runoff. These measures not only improved the canal's water supply but also allowed for the removal of three locks, reducing the total number of locks from 13 to 10 by 1892.",

Since its transfer to the University of Dar-es-Salaam in 1968, the forest has been actively protected by a full-time Forest Guard, and scientists have been encouraged to study its unique biodiversity. The forest serves as a critical buffer zone against encroachment and is vital for water catchment, supporting the headwaters of the Mkole, Luengera, and Pangani streams. However, the forest faces significant threats, particularly from logging pressures and farmland expansion to the east, which make it vulnerable to degradation.",

The grid includes 36 coarse composite elements for the Central and SE Geysers and 170 composite elements per layer for the NW Geysers, resulting in a total of 2,184 blocks (546 for the fracture system and 1,638 for the rock matrix). Additionally, a block representing the Shallow Thermal reservoir of the Central Geysers was added to the eastern side of the model. The dual porosity formulation (MINC method) was employed, with each composite element consisting of a fracture block and three nested blocks representing the rock matrix. The model spans an area of approximately 182 km², with the NW Geysers' detailed representation covering about 68 km². All outer boundaries of the model were considered closed to heat and mass flow.",

The figure highlights the transformation of this pocket beach due to human interventions, including the construction of a new seawall, a groin at the west end of the coastline, and beach nourishment efforts. Originally characterized by a dynamically varying shoreline, the construction of the groin created a wave-shelter zone, leading to significant shoreline changes. Sand deposition was accelerated inside the wave-shelter zone, causing shoreline advance west of the groin, while erosion occurred east of the groin. The predominant wave direction on this coast is indicated as normal to the shoreline. The maximum shoreline advance and recession between August 1987 and March 1991 reached 10 m at the foot of the groin and 5 m at the central part of the pocket beach, respectively. These changes illustrate the impact of coastal engineering structures on sediment transport and shoreline dynamics.",

At lower altitudes, spheroidal obsidian bombs, up to [size] in long-axis, are observed in the lower part of Unit B. These units also indent overlying pumice-fallout layers and tend to thin at higher altitudes along the caldera wall.

The warm surface waters with low salinity observed in the northeastern shallow areas are indicative of this phenomenon. The SST data does not reveal significant anomalies in the surface temperatures, but the near-bottom waters, particularly in the AGS section, appear warmer and less dense compared to historical data. This feature is especially evident in areas where the lower salinity waters, mixed with Gulf Coastal Waters (GCW), exhibit salinities above 35.",

The species has been found across multiple years and seasons in the Rio de la Plata estuary, suggesting it is a resident species in this region. Mysidopsis rionegrensis was first described from the Gulf of San Matías, characterized by high salinity waters (33.8–34.1), and its distribution has now been extended northeastward along Buenos Aires coastal waters, within salinities of 33.7–33.9. The absence of M. rionegrensis in lower salinity regions, such as the El Rincón estuarine system and the Rio de la Plata estuary, suggests salinity tolerance may limit its distribution.

Precipitation trends are capped at ±1 mm/month for individual months (a–e) and ±10 mm/season for the full season (f). Gray areas indicate regions where trends are statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). The maps reveal distinct spatial patterns in precipitation trends over the 36-year period. In August (c) and September (d), a positive precipitation trend is observed north of the Sahel, while central West Africa shows slight increases in precipitation during June (a) and July (b). Along the Coast of Guinea, October (e) exhibits a positive precipitation trend near the N latitude. For the entire rainy season (f), a positive trend in precipitation is evident across the latitude, consistent with broader regional analyses. These findings align with previous studies, which report increasing precipitation during the late rainy season and overall positive trends in precipitation across West Africa during this period.",

These north-dipping reflections, though weaker in Profile 5, are interpreted as representing a major shear zone, separating the Skellefte volcanics, a seismic-transparent zone, from a more reflective zone beneath. This feature is associated with a crustal shear zone, where the Skellefte volcanics may have been thrust over an older domain. The deeper, north-dipping unit is interpreted as Bothnian Basin rocks, consistent with potential field modeling. The contact between these north-dipping reflections and the overlying transparent zone is a key element in understanding the region’s geological structure. Additionally, the interpretation suggests that the Kristineberg ore lies within the northern limb of a synformal structure, extending to significant depths.",

These paths highlight potential groundwater transfers from Spring Valley to Snake Valley, particularly at the southern and northern ends of the Snake Range. However, Gillespie et al. (2012) questioned the likelihood of significant interbasin fluxes at the southern end, citing evidence such as the pre-Holocene residence times of Snake Valley waters, which would not align with the displacement expected from large interbasin flows. Systematic differences in well depths may explain the observed age gradients, with shallow wells intersecting Holocene water and deeper wells tapping Pleistocene aquifers.

The Qs values in the collision zone are low near the ground surface, consistent with sedimentary layers, but the low-Qs values to the west of the Hokkaido-Miyagi Ridge (HMR) extend beyond the sedimentary layers. **c** The Qs structure in Region A, which shows relatively high-Qs values sandwiched between low-Qs zones, extending to deeper portions on the eastern side of the HMR. These structures suggest the obduction of mid/lower crust and mantle wedge materials beneath the Kuril arc, as previously noted by Tsumura et al. (1996) and Iwasaki et al. (2004). The low-Qs zones, particularly in the southern part of the cross-section, indicate S-wave attenuation in the frontal areas of the collision zone. The depth of the low-Qs zone correlates with high-Vp values in Region A, suggesting high-attenuation properties in the collision zone’s frontal areas. The presence of metamorphic materials, such as serpentine, along the HMR further supports this interpretation, with large-amplitude seismic decays observed due to the serpentine (Nakamura et al., 2006; Nakajima et al., 2013). Faults in the collision zone likely contribute to S-wave attenuation, and the low-Qs values in b may reflect these heterogeneities. The study’s estimated Qs values account for both scattering and intrinsic seismic attenuation, with lateral variations in Qs indicating small-scale faults or cracks, particularly in areas adjacent to seismic events such as the Iburi Earthquake. The observed lateral changes in Qs could also represent vertical structural boundaries, possibly reflecting the interaction between the northeastern Japan arc and the mantle wedge.",

Panels (c) and (d) display the differences in OLR anomalies between the two datasets for the tropical and global domains, respectively. The variability of HIRS OLR anomalies generally aligns with CERES OLR products, except during the 2000–2002 period, where a notable discrepancy is observed, the cause of which remains unclear. The differences in anomalies exhibit varying degrees of linear trends, which, despite the relatively short ten-year data length for trend assessment, suggest potential data stability issues. These trends may be influenced by factors such as an abrupt switch in the Aqua time series caused by the SW channel failure in FM4. Further investigations are necessary to address these discrepancies and improve the consistency of HIRS OLR estimation models across different instrument versions.",

The results are shown for the central part of the domain. The potential temperature plots (a, b) reveal that the atmosphere above the city is near neutrally stratified up to approximately 200 m above ground level and is warmer compared to the rural area, where a strong stable stratification is observed. This difference arises because the urban area cools less rapidly at night due to reduced longwave radiation loss caused by radiation trapping within the urban canyon structure, a phenomenon absent in the base case simulation. The TKE plots (e, f) highlight a region of higher turbulence above the city, corresponding to the neutrally stratified layer. In contrast, the rural area exhibits significantly lower turbulence.

Seismic line interpretation across the eastern Gulf of Mexico (GoM), illustrating the structural and stratigraphic relationships from the Florida Platform to the inferred axial graben of the extinct Jurassic spreading center.** The seismic profile highlights the lapout of Haynesville–Buckner (HVB), Cotton Valley–Bossier (CVB), and Cotton Valley–Knowles (CVK) supersequences onto oceanic crust, providing evidence of the timing and extent of sea-floor spreading. Correlated seismic horizons include the Sligo–Hosston (SH), Navarro–Taylor (NT), and Paleogene (Wilcox) supersequences, which further constrain the stratigraphic framework. The extinct spreading center is characterized by a wide axial valley (~12 miles), deep axial troughs, normal faults dipping toward the valley, and isolated basement highs, consistent with slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge morphology. These features suggest a spreading rate comparable to global slow-spreading ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The seismic interpretation confirms that Upper Jurassic (Smackover and Norphlet) strata downlap onto oceanic crust, indicating contemporaneous deposition with crust formation. Latest Upper Jurassic and Cotton Valley intervals extend across the oceanic crust, marking the cessation of spreading. This seismic line, modified from Snedden et al.

The left panel represents the annual-mean climatology from PHC, while the right panel shows the model solution averaged over a 10-year period. The comparison reveals notable differences in the spatial distribution of freshwater content between the two datasets. In the PHC climatology, regions of high freshwater content are concentrated along the Arctic border of the western Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), whereas in the model solution, this high freshwater content extends eastward toward the entrance of Nares Strait. Additionally, the model underestimates freshwater content in Baffin Bay compared to PHC, which is attributed to a positive bias in modeled salinity. This salinity bias impacts the freshwater flux through Nares Strait and contributes to discrepancies in sea surface height (SSH) gradients between the Arctic and Baffin Bay. These biases highlight the need for improved model parameterization, including adjustments to lateral boundary conditions and viscosity settings, to better capture the complex dynamics of freshwater distribution and flow in the region.",

This reverse fault is situated in the middle part of the island slope between the isobaths 500 m and 6000 m, spanning the latitudinal interval from approximately 38°–38.5°N in the north to ~35.5°N in the south. The bedding depth of the fault likely reaches several tens of kilometers, and the rupture length is estimated to be within 200–300 km. Empirical correlations suggest that such a rupture length corresponds to a vertical slip of up to 10 m, which is conducive to generating tsunami waves. \n\nThe northern boundary of the earthquake source is defined by a steep reverse fault striking sublatitudinally and obliquely cutting the island arc near latitudes 38°–38.5°N. This structural boundary is evidenced by the clustering of earthquake epicenters in this region, the sublatitudinal band of aftershock epicenters from the 1978 earthquake, and the focal mechanisms of the main shock and foreshock of the March 11, 2011 event. The southern boundary of the source is less clearly defined but is presumed to be a sublatitudinal reverse fault with a moderate dip angle near latitudes ~35.5°N, where the dense cloud of aftershock epicenters terminates. This boundary may be reflected in the focal mechanism of a magnitude 6.1 aftershock that occurred on March 22, 2011 at the southern edge of the main aftershock zone. The axis of the deep-sea trench is also depicted in the figure, providing additional structural context for the earthquake source region.",

Additionally, epidote-blueschist facies structures are observed in the distal part of the thinned Corsican continental margin, now represented by the Tenda unit. The evolution of this phase suggests the indentation of the Nebbio-Calabria back-stop and the northern tip of the AlKaPeCa microcontinent, which is depicted in  The indentation system is possibly represented by the Santa Lucia Nappe in central Corsica, although the precise paleotectonic position, bulk deformation structure, and relationships with the Schistes Lustres unit remain a topic of debate (Durand-Delga, 1984).",

In CTL (a), as the storm intensifies, the eyewall, characterized by ascending motion, gradually thickens, accompanied by a slow increase in the tropical cyclone (TC) inner-core size, with the radius of maximum wind (RMW) expanding from 20 km to approximately 50 km throughout the simulation. After 72 hours, the outward expansion and broadening of the eyewall suppress the rainbands outside the eyewall, leaving a wide region of descending motion. In contrast, C30 (b) exhibits a distinct evolution. During the early stage (63–72 hours), convective activity is relatively subdued in the inner-core region, while convective updrafts are evident immediately outside the RMW. After 72 hours, robust outer-core rainbands develop, leading to enhanced outer-core convective heating and outward expansion of hurricane-force winds. Vigorous convective updrafts emerge within the inner-core region from 84 hours onward, culminating in the formation of a strong concentric convective ring at 96 hours at a radius of 30 km, which triggers the first jump in RMW from 18 km to 30 km. Subsequently, the concentric convective ring contracts inward, the primary eyewall dissipates, and the concentric convective eyewall replaces it, completing the first eyewall replacement cycle (ERC). After 120 hours, a new thick convective eyewall forms at a radius of 50 km, causing the inner eyewall to collapse again and the RMW to experience a second jump from 25 km to 50 km. By the end of the simulation, the TC structure in C30 resembles an annular hurricane, characterized by a large eye and wide eyewall.",

The bright spot is characterized by an amplitude anomaly resulting from the contrast in acoustic impedance caused by hydrocarbon saturation. Additionally, a less prominent \"flat spot\" feature is observable, which corresponds to the interface between two different saturating fluids, such as oil and water. However, in this case, interference phenomena and lateral velocity variations in the overburden have distorted the flat spot, complicating its characterization.

In the equatorial Pacific, several models exhibit weak positive correlations, while others generate negative correlations contrary to observed patterns. Near eastern Australia, the teleconnection strength varies widely, ranging from models with negligible correlations to those with excessively strong correlations. Additionally, most models simulate stronger ENSO–rainfall teleconnections over northwest Australia compared to eastern Australia. The models are organized by ENSO amplitude, measured by the standard deviation of Niño-3.4, increasing down each column and from left to right. The results suggest that ENSO amplitude plays a critical role in controlling the strength of ENSO–rainfall teleconnections, with stronger ENSO amplitudes generally associated with more pronounced teleconnections.",

These regions were delineated using flood-frequency data from 100 gauging stations in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN), which includes stations with long-term records (greater than 25 years) and minimal regulation impacts. The curves were constructed using the index flood method, which assumes uniform flood-frequency distributions within each region. \n\nThe northwest region (MNDAK) exhibits a steep flood-frequency curve, indicating a high variability in flood discharges, with the 100-year flood (Q100) reaching up to seven times the mean annual flood. In contrast, the curves for regions to the southeast (MO-IL and IA-WI) are progressively flatter, reflecting lower variability, with Q100 at most three times the mean annual flood. The Mississippi River flood-frequency curve at Keokuk is notably flatter than the regional curves, signifying a narrow range of flood discharges due to the large drainage area of the river, which disperses precipitation and runoff events across the basin. This characteristic makes extreme floods, such as those exceeding twice the mean annual flood, exceptionally rare for the Mississippi River at this location.",

For example, during the 1965 drought, over half of the basin area was in moderate drought, a substantial portion in severe drought, and a smaller fraction in extreme dry conditions. Spatial panels reveal that the northern part of the basin is particularly vulnerable to droughts, exhibiting high cumulative severity values, as seen in the 1965 and 1972 droughts.

The 1997 drought shows pronounced dryness in southern regions, while the 2002 drought features concentrated patches of severe drought in the source region.

The study area is located near Madrid, Spain, with altitudes ranging from 908.2 m to the highest elevations in the northwest. The UTM zone 30N coordinates span X: 424,303.456 to 434,563.431 and Y: 4,494,559.721 to 4,484,299.529. The terrain is characterized by two geomorphological units corresponding to the watersheds of the Manzanares River and its tributary, the Trofa Creek. The Manzanares River basin exhibits a uniform southeast-to-northwest slope with predominantly gentle topography, while the Trofa Creek basin features steeper slopes and a less extensive drainage network. Four transects are marked on the DTM: west-to-east (W–E), north-to-south (N–S), southwest-to-northeast (SW–NE), and southeast-to-northwest (SE–NW). These transects were selected for statistical and scaling analyses, including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), to study the anisotropic characteristics of the terrain. The SE–NW transect crosses the Manzanares River drainage network and approaches the divide between the two basins, while the W–E transect traverses the Trofa Creek basin and the midpoint of the Manzanares River basin, where a reservoir is located. The SW–NE transect intersects both basins diagonally, and the N–S transect crosses the drainage divide and partially traverses the Manzanares River basin. The DTM highlights the geomorphological features and directional variations in the landscape, which are influenced by the processes shaping the river basins.",

In the headwater reach, river flow is primarily fed by Petrov Lake, which serves as a modified proxy for glacial outflow, and deep upstream groundwater, with minor contributions from mine discharge. Petrov Lake's isotopic signature reflects a combination of snow and ice melt, groundwater, and rain, with potential fractionation due to evaporation. As distance from the glacier increases, direct contributions from glacial meltwater diminish, and river sources transition to being dominated by groundwater and snowmelt. This shift is evident just above Naryn town, where groundwater becomes the primary contributor to river flow, with glacial waters playing a subsidiary role. The observed trends underscore the gradual dilution of ions across the elevation gradient and the evolving influence of different source waters along the river's course.",

The horizontal axis represents the vegetation indices (EVI, LSWI, NDSVI, NDTI, and VIgreen), while the vertical axis corresponds to 31 time periods spanning the crop growing season. Each grid cell in the chart displays the SI value for a specific feature \\( F(m,n) \\), where \\( m \\) is the VI and \\( n \\) is the time period. Higher SI values, indicated by increasingly red grid cells, signify greater separability between the two classes for the corresponding feature. The charts reveal dynamic changes in separability over time and across VIs, reflecting phenological events during the crop growing season. For instance, during days 130–155 (late May), the \"rice-corn\" pairwise chart shows a high SI for LSWI, as rice transplanting results in significantly higher water content in paddy fields compared to corn fields at the emergence stage. These charts highlight the variability in separability across different pairwise classes and emphasize the utility of multi-temporal VIs in capturing subtle differences for effective crop classification. EVI: enhanced vegetation index; LSWI: land surface water index; NDSVI: normalized difference senescent vegetation index; NDTI: normalized difference tillage index; VIgreen: green vegetation index.",

The figure illustrates the diverse spatial patterns of SWE trends, with positive trends predominantly located in the Karakoram, Pamir, Kunlun Shan, and high Himalaya regions. In contrast, the most pronounced negative trends are observed in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, particularly at the headwaters of the Yangtze, Salween, and Mekong rivers. The analysis reveals that the majority of HMA experiences negative SWE trends, with declines being more pronounced in the higher end of the monthly SWE distribution. This suggests that high-SWE values are becoming less frequent, aligning with increasing temperature trends in the region. Additionally, the figure highlights the variability in SWE trends, with some areas exhibiting alternating positive and negative patterns, likely influenced by extreme topography and microclimates. The trends are further characterized by a more than six-fold increase in the 90th percentile monthly SWE compared to the 10th percentile, indicating a significant rise in the frequency or magnitude of high-SWE days, potentially driven by stronger Winter Westerlies. Conversely, in the Pamir, positive SWE trends are associated with increases in low-magnitude SWE rather than high-magnitude events.",

Notably, the Jacuípe Basin lacks pre-rift sequences, with Barremian to Aptian rift deposits directly overlying the Precambrian basement.

These features contrast with the non-volcanic nature of the adjacent Camamu and Almada basins to the south. The seismic profile provides critical insights into the tectono-magmatic processes that shaped the basin during the rift and post-rift stages. (After Mohriak et al., 1998)",

The semiconfining unit is traceable across the majority of the data cube, although manual picking was required in areas of lower amplitude and less coherent reflections, particularly on the western side of the grid. These lower amplitudes are not migration artifacts and may be influenced by non-uniform radiation patterns of the dipole antennas used during the survey. The insets on the left display migrated time slices at depths of 2.35, 2.58, and 2.83 meters (assuming a velocity of 0.070 m/ns), revealing the conical geometry of the basal tapering of the depression. The data also suggest the presence of conduits or dropdowns within the semiconfining unit, indicated by reduced-amplitude returns and weak circular diffractions visible in the time slices. These features are consistent with steep, narrow conduits that punctuate the broader depression and play a critical role in groundwater recharge.",

Measurements are conducted at a safe distance from the ice edge to minimize the effects of melting near the edge. Ice thickness, snow thickness, and freeboard are measured using drill holes created with an auger. A measurement stick with a notch or a tape-measure thickness gauge is used for ice thickness, while snow thickness is determined using a metal stake with markings. Monitoring typically involves observations at four to five sites, with drillings performed approximately every two weeks as long as site access is possible. At each site, three holes are drilled in the corners of a triangle with a side length of 1 meter to account for variability, and the measurement data from the three holes are averaged. Site locations are recorded using GPS. Additionally, a detailed 1-week field campaign is conducted annually in April or early May, coinciding with the period of maximum sea ice and snow thickness.

Regions with the highest evaporation are located in the northwest and southwest areas. In the northwest, high evaporation is attributed to the largest precipitation levels and extensive human activities, including large-scale agricultural cultivation, which alters the land surface and contributes significant moisture to the atmosphere during certain seasons. In the southwest, despite lower precipitation levels, the presence of massive glaciers provides substantial water for evaporation. Conversely, the central region, dominated by the Taklimakan Desert, exhibits the lowest evaporation values due to the absence of vegetation and water sources, despite the desert's strong evaporation potential. This spatial variation highlights the interplay between natural factors, such as terrain and precipitation, and human activities in shaping the evaporation patterns across the Tarim River basin.",

The data undergoes pre-processing using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) and the Landsat Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) for atmospheric correction. Poor quality data due to clouds, cloud shadows, snow, and ice are masked out. The data extraction and pre-processing are implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform. The workflow utilizes all seven spectral bands of the Landsat product, including blue, green, red, near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) 1, SWIR 2, and thermal infrared (TIR). A circular buffer centered on each FLUXNET tower is used to extract mean values within the Landsat cutouts, representing the EC footprint area. The figure also depicts the gap-filling procedures: initially, a Random Forest model predicts monthly reflectance values using MODIS bands as predictors, followed by a second gap-filling using climate variables, plant functional types, month, and latitude.

The Arava Valley image, acquired on 14 December 2014, was selected due to a significant crude oil spill that occurred on 4 December 2014, depositing an estimated 3–5 million liters of oil into the soil. This area was used to contrast with the Marañon River in Peru, where a major oil spill occurred on 22 August 2016 due to a pipeline disruption, contaminating the river with crude oil. The Marañon River image was captured on 27 August 2016. These contrasting environments were critical for evaluating the classification strategy, which defined two categories: \"water\" (open water bodies) and \"no-water\" (all other features, such as land, vegetation, and urban areas).

In the $4\\times\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ experiment, the rainbelt undergoes a similar seasonal migration but is shifted poleward by several degrees compared to the standard experiment.

Both provinces shared a similar configuration, consisting of a western volcanic arc, a central unstable forearc basin, and an eastern continental slope and ocean basin associated with a westerly dipping subduction zone. The volcanic arcs, such as the Connors-Auburn Volcanic Arc in the Yarrol Province, were of an Andean-type continental margin, characterized by thick subaerial volcanic deposits, including andesite, dacite, rhyolite, and basalt. These volcanics are dated to the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous based on stratigraphic correlations and radiometric dating.\n\nThe Yarrol and Tamworth Forearc Basins developed east of the volcanic arcs, with the southern Yarrol Forearc Basin unconformably overlying deformed rocks of the earlier Calliope Island Arc. This indicates that the Calliope Island Arc had reached its current position relative to the New England Fold Belt by the Late Devonian. East of the forearc basins, deep-water flysch-type sediments were deposited in the Wandilla Slope and Basin and the Texas-Coffs Harbour Slope and Basin, forming accretionary wedges typical of subduction complexes. Major fault systems, such as the Yarrol and Peel Fault Systems, separate the subduction complex rocks from the forearc basin strata, with serpentinite lenses marking these fault zones.\n\nThe figure also depicts the distribution of Early Carboniferous volcanics and volcaniclastic sediments beneath the Mesozoic cover of the Great Artesian Basin, as revealed by petroleum exploration wells. These strata are correlated with the Yarrol-Tamworth Forearc Basin sequence but may also include elements of the Connors-Auburn Volcanic Arc. Additionally, the figure highlights the southern continuation of the Yarrol Forearc Basin, evidenced by isolated inliers of volcaniclastic sediments and crinoidal limestone lenses at locations such as Alice Creek, Mt Barney, and the Emu Creek Block. These sequences transition eastward into deep-water flysch deposits, reflecting the forearc basin to continental slope-ocean basin environments. The palaeogeography underscores the diachronous cessation of subduction within the New England Fold Belt, with volcanism ceasing in the Connors-Auburn Volcanic Arc by the end of the Early Carboniferous, while persisting in the Tamworth Forearc Basin into the Middle and Late Carboniferous.",

The figure highlights a widespread zone of landslide incidence running east-west, approximately parallel to the transition between the Lesser and High Himalayas. Landslide concentrations are highest near the earthquake epicenter, with a significant extension of landslides towards the east, likely due to the eastward-directed fault rupture and subsequent aftershock activity. The landslides triggered by the main shock and aftershocks overlap in the eastern region, though their distinction is unclear due to the short time between events. Notable valley-blocking landslides, such as the one that buried the village of Baisari, are also indicated. The distribution of landslides is closely correlated with the geological features of the region, including the outcrop of Upper Lesser Himalayan rocks (phyllite, meta-sandstone), which is bounded by the Main Central Thrust (MCT). Many landslides occur near the MCT, suggesting fault structures may have influenced the clustering of landslides. The figure also shows a marked increase in landslide density around the epicentral area, highlighting regions with elevated landslide risk during future monsoon seasons. South-facing slopes are particularly prone to landslides, and the figure further emphasizes the ongoing hazard posed by reactivated landslides, particularly in areas with steep, fractured, and weathered materials.",

A multi-resolution segmentation algorithm was applied to aerial imagery from two time points (initial and final) to generate polygon features based on texture and color using eCognition Developer 64 (version 8.8). The parameters for segmentation included scale, shape, and compactness, resulting in 4,778 to 15,578 polygons per image, depending on the proximity of the seagrass meadow to land-based objects such as buildings. These polygons were converted into shapefiles and manually classified in ArcGIS to identify *P. australis* habitat.

Negative values represent southward transport, which dominates the average meridional flux across the region. Northward transport is limited to specific areas, including the Ross Sea, the Weddell Sea, and certain regions of the Antarctic continent, particularly near the Lambert Glacier and the western Ross Sea.

The striking contrast between the black iron-rich mass of Alquife, the white dolomite of the Alcohorra (each crowned by a Moorish castle), and the gray backdrop of the Sierra Nevadas creates a visually dramatic landscape.",

The map highlights four structural decks of the gneiss belt, each represented by distinct colours: the Palaeoproterozoic parautochthon (blue), the tectonic duplex (violet), the Mesoproterozoic allochthon (green), and the Parry Sound domain (yellow). The Mesoproterozoic allochthon is further divided into two segments: the Muskoka segment (lighter green) and the segment underlying Parry Sound (darker green), which are interpreted as originally part of a single thrust sheet later disrupted by tectonic processes. \n\nThe Parry Sound domain, characterized by its abundance of mafic rocks and associated large positive gravity anomaly, is a significant lithotectonic unit. This domain is surrounded by a nearly complete ring of the allochthon, except on its northeastern side, where it abuts the Powassan batholith. The Powassan batholith, marked by a negative gravity anomaly, likely acted as a buoyant body, uplifting and eroding the overlying allochthon in this region.\n\nKey structural features include the Allochthon Boundary Thrust (ABT), which is traced along the western side of the Parry Sound domain and passes near retrogressed eclogite outcrops (red stars) and a dated coronitic metagabbro outcrop (large green star). The Duplex Boundary, a significant zone of crustal shortening, separates the duplex from the overlying allochthon. Additionally, the Lower Go Home and Lower Rosseau tectonic windows are identified to the south of the Parry Sound domain, with evidence of crustal exhumation and retrogressed eclogite pods associated with these windows.\n\nThe map also identifies smaller tectonic klippen, such as the Honey Harbour domain and the Bethune–Proudfoot klippen, which are interpreted as remnants of allochthonous terranes preserved due to the down-buckling effect of the Parry Sound domain. These klippen, along with the larger Moon River and Seguin nappes, form a series of northwest-directed allochthonous terranes. The Algonquin domain to the east is reinterpreted as a thin-skinned tectonic duplex, potentially perforated by additional tectonic windows and klippen.\n\nSymbols on the map include stars representing metabasic rock types: red stars for eclogite, green stars for coronitic olivine metagabbro (large stars indicate dated samples, small stars indicate undated samples), and open stars for Sudbury diabase equivalents.

(2) With increased static stability ($\\sigma_{0} \\times 1.5$, ${\\theta_{A}}^{**} = 0.2$) and the Hadley initial condition, stationary waves of smaller scales exhibit reduced amplitudes, resulting in a smoother flow pattern.

The simulation accurately captures vertical and downstream facies evolutions, particularly during the spilling stage (depositional sequences C to F). Prograding conglomerate-dominated deposits with downlap surfaces transition downstream into sand-dominated deposits. Sequence A represents a fining upward evolution from sand to shale, pinching out downstream on the frontal slope due to frontal onlap. Additionally, a local source southeast of Annot was required to account for massive sand deposits that are time-equivalent to thin-bedded turbidites at St Antonin. Sequence B exhibits a coarsening and shallowing upward succession.  \n\nb highlights the depositional dynamics during the spilling stage, where variations in water discharge and flow strength near the frontal slope of the Annot sub-basin and the Grand Coyer trough enhance flow efficiency. The underfilled nature of the Trois Eveches sub-basin during spillover creates a slope break at the exit of the confined Grand Coyer trough, maintaining high flow energy downstream. Sequence D and the lower part of sequence E mark the maximum progradation of the system, driven by high sediment supply and water discharge, resulting in the aggradation of coarse material downstream. At the top of sequence D, the basin floor morphology is smoothed, with depositional slope controlling the basin floor topography. Sequences E and F reflect the retrogradation of the system.",

The data were recorded using spiked geophones. Englacial reflectors are visible throughout the record, particularly in the upper half, with a strong englacial reflector running approximately parallel to the bed above the prominent ice/bed interface reflection at a two-way travel time (TWT) of 0.48 ms, corresponding to the ice/bed contact depth. (b) Shot record from the 2011 survey (HRexp2011), generated using 800 g of pentolite in a 12 m deep borehole and recorded with a snowstreamer equipped with geophone arrays. Englacial reflections are more pronounced at near offsets, as the geophone arrays act as a low-pass filter, reducing the recorded amplitudes of reflections at larger incidence angles (farther offsets). (c) Shot record from the 2011 vibroseis survey (HRvib2011), created using a vibroseis sweep (10 s, 10–100 Hz) at the same location as (b). Despite significant ground roll obscuring parts of the data, the deepest englacial reflector is clearly visible. The vibroseis source, which excites vertical particle motion at the surface, primarily generates elastic wave energy. However, due to the firn's energy-trapping properties and the continuous densification with depth, much of the energy is refracted back to the surface, limiting wave penetration below the firn/ice transition.",

The May 2 magnitude 6.6 earthquake (event A) is tentatively associated with flexural slip on the northeast flank of the Coalinga anticline, a structure characterized by steeply dipping Cretaceous-Cenozoic strata and significant coseismic uplift. The strike and dip of the Cretaceous beds at hypocenter depth align with the steep northeast-dipping plane of the first-motion solution for this event and its large aftershocks on May 9 and May 24 (events B and D). The May 22 magnitude 4.3 earthquake (event C), located 8 miles east of Coalinga, is attributed to reverse slip on a south-dipping bedding plane near the southeast plunge of the anticline. The magnitude 4 earthquake of June 12 (event F), 2 miles south-southeast of Coalinga, is linked to slip on a northeast-dipping bedding plane on the southwest flank of the Coalinga syncline. Additionally, earthquakes clustered 6 to 9 miles north-northwest of Coalinga (events G, H, I, and J) are tentatively attributed to flexural slip on the southwest flank of the Coalinga syncline, though alternative interpretations suggest these may be aftershocks of the June 11 magnitude 5.2 Nunez fault-generated earthquake.

The changes were triggered by the construction of a groin at the west end of the coastline, which created a wave-shelter zone and induced significant erosion and accretion along the pocket beach. The predominant wave direction on this coast is indicated as normal to the shoreline. A straight line drawn through the tip of the groin intersects the August 1987 shoreline at a reference point, denoted as Point A. East of Point A, the shoreline experienced widespread retreat, with a maximum recession of 14 m observed in the central part of the pocket beach. Conversely, west of Point A, the shoreline advanced, with a maximum accretion of 18 m occurring at the foot of the groin. These changes highlight the redistribution of sand caused by the groin, which obstructed longshore sand transport and redirected sediment into the wave-shelter zone. The figure provides a clear depiction of the spatial variability in shoreline response, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between coastal structures and natural sediment transport processes.",

During the Early Eocene, subduction shifted southward from its Mesozoic position due to the accretion of the South-Armenia block and possibly the Sanandaj–Sirjan block during the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleogene. This shift resulted in the relocation of volcanic activity and back-arc extension zones further south. In the Jurassic, the distance between the subduction zone and the back-arc extension area was likely much smaller than it appears today due to the different relative positions of tectonic blocks at that time. By the Eocene, Neo-Tethys subduction was active further south, and extension and volcanism occurred in small, elongated basins such as the Achara-Trialet, Erevan-Ordubad, Talesh, and areas south of the Alborz. These basins, often filled with deep-water flysch and volcanic deposits such as andesites and tuffs, were associated with normal faulting and significant extension, particularly in the Talesh Basin and the Great Kavir Basin. In contrast, the SCB remained a strong, undeformed lithospheric block during the Eocene, surrounded by rift-like basins that followed its southern margin. The arcuate patterns of the Talesh and Alborz regions reflect the shape of the resistant oceanic basement of the SCB.",

The range, composed primarily of shales and sandstones deposited during the upper Eocene and Oligocene, exhibits steeply dipping bedding planes that form an east-west trending belt due to tectonic uplift. Major streams drain away from the Santa Ynez Ridge, with tributaries often following the strike of less resistant shale formations. (d) Spatially interpolated surface of bedding dip generated using ordinary kriging from 61 digitized strike/dip points from Dibblee (1986). The kriging model used a semi-variogram with a range of 1570, a sill of 119, and a low nugget value, reflecting minimal spatially uncorrelated noise due to dense sampling. Bedding dip angles vary from near-horizontal at the basin's headwaters to vertical positions, with most beds dipping in a south-southwest direction. However, a few measurements near the base of the watershed indicate northward dips, creating a boundary between south-facing and overturned north-facing beds. This boundary, not explicitly marked on Dibblee's map, is represented as a transition zone in the kriging model.",

Delta systems prograded from the west into shallow marine carbonate platforms, which were prevalent in the north, west-central, and southern parts of Novaya Zemlya and the Timan–Pechora region. Thick carbonate buildups formed along platform edges and elevated areas, primarily composed of rugose corals and reef structures.  \n- **(b) Carboniferous (Viseán):** Tropical humid climatic conditions prevailed, with terrestrial siliciclastic deposits in the west transitioning into marine carbonate shelves in the east. Shallow marine carbonate regimes dominated Novaya Zemlya and the eastern Barents Shelf, while deeper marine carbonate deposition occurred in localized basins.  \n- **(c) Early Permian (Asselian):** Widespread carbonate shelf environments characterized the region, dissected by structural highs and shallow basins. The western Barents Sea represented a northeasterly extension of the Late Palaeozoic Atlantic rift, while deep-water basins persisted in the eastern Barents Sea and Kara Sea.  \n- **(d) Late Permian (Kazanian):** Distal marine, low-energy shelf environments dominated the western shelf, with cool-water bryozoan carbonates forming low-relief platforms during sea-level highstands. Shallow marine to slope and deep basin facies characterized Novaya Zemlya and the eastern Barents Shelf, while uplifted areas to the east contributed clastic sediments to deltaic and continental deposits in Timan–Pechora.  \n- **(e) Early Triassic (Olenekian):** Maximum marine transgression occurred, with shorelines extending across the Finnmark Platform, Timan–Pechora, and Novaya Zemlya. An epeirogenic sea covered the Barents Sea basins and platforms, forming deep marine conditions conducive to petroleum source rock deposition.  \n- **(f) Late Triassic (Carnian):** Maximum regression resulted in widespread estuarine and fluvial sedimentation, with delta systems prograding from the east. Shorelines extended along the elevated Novaya Zemlya and Fennoscandian hinterland, while terrestrial deposits dominated the platforms.  \n- **(g) Early Jurassic (Toarcian):** Continental conditions persisted in the South Barents Basin, transitioning to marine environments during Bajocian transgression. Shallow marine strata dominated the western Barents Sea, while regressive-transgressive shoreline units characterized the depositional patterns.  \n\nThese reconstructions reflect the interplay of tectonic activity, climatic shifts, and sedimentary processes that shaped the palaeogeography of the Barents Sea region during the Late Devonian to Early Jurassic periods.",

Four major sectors of air mass origin were identified: north-eastern (N–E), north-western (N–W), west-south-western (W–SW), and south-south-eastern (S–SE). The N–E sector was the most frequent, predominantly occurring during summer, while the S–SE sector was the least frequent, prevailing mainly in spring and carrying marine chemical features influenced by the Black Sea. The W–SW sector was dominant during winter, and the N–W sector showed slightly enhanced frequency in both winter and summer, potentially reflecting European monsoon circulation. The figure also highlights air masses undergoing faster vertical transport, which were identified as traveling over large continental areas (long-range transport) or local regions (short-range transport). Specific sampling events, such as those in April 2016, demonstrate instances where air masses descended to near-ground levels, significantly impacting the chemical composition of collected particles. Additionally, the S–SE sector during spring 2016 suggests contributions from sea spray aerosols originating from the Black Sea or other marine areas.",

Two offsets in the Compton-Los Alamitos fold trend define geometric segment boundaries of the underlying Compton thrust ramp. The first offset occurs at Potrero Gap, south of the Baldwin Hills, where the fold trend narrows abruptly and is disrupted, likely overlying a lateral ramp or fault discontinuity. The second offset is located between the San Gabriel and Santa Ana Rivers, similarly suggesting a fault discontinuity that segments the underlying blind-thrust ramp. \n\nThe Elysian Park thrust ramp, located in the northern Los Angeles basin, is divided into two segments: the Los Angeles segment (IV) and the Whittier segment (V).

The nuclides migrate through the buffer material of the engineered barrier system (EBS), diffuse to the outer boundary of the buffer, and subsequently enter the excavation-damaged zone (EDZ), where they are transported by groundwater flow. From the EDZ, radionuclides are released into the natural barrier and migrate horizontally through the host rock. The transport continues vertically through a regional-scale major water-conducting feature (MWCF), which extends from repository depth to the surface, spanning a length on the order of a kilometer or more. The MWCF is modeled as a single representative fracture with advective-dispersive transport, retarded by matrix diffusion into the adjacent rock and sorption onto pore surfaces.

Via Blanca is characterized as an urban-industrial station due to its proximity to industrial activity and moderate chloride aerosol exposure, while Viriato and Cojimar are coastal stations situated at sea level near the northern shoreline. Quivican, located further inland, was used to evaluate the inland reach of chloride aerosols and their role in corrosion processes.",

Deep anomalies in the west were driven by wind stress curl associated with equatorial easterlies following the 1969 El Niño, while shallow anomalies in the east originated from boundary radiation. The model captures the shoaling event of 1972 as a continuous upwelling signal radiating from the eastern boundary and amplifying in the mid-basin due to wind stress curl.  \n(c) Model solution of ULT (m) with the eastern boundary condition set to zero, isolating the contribution of interior wind stress curl.

Each plot consists of two panels: the upper panel shows the relative returned (attenuated) lidar backscatter power on a logarithmic grayscale (white indicates the strongest range-normalized signal), while the lower panel displays the lidar linear depolarization ratio (δ) using a color scale provided at the top of the figure. All plots begin at an altitude of 0.5 km above mean sea level (a.m.s.l.), as signals below this altitude are unreliable due to incomplete laser/receiver overlap. White areas in the depolarization panels represent regions with insufficient signal to calculate δ. Time values are in UTC, and the date of lidar data collection is indicated at the top of each image.**\n\n**(A) 4 April:** Observations show a weakly backscattering boundary layer aerosol beneath a bright, high cirrus cloud layer. The boundary layer top is sporadically marked by ice scud clouds composed of horizontally oriented plate crystals, generating near-zero depolarization. Near the surface, average δ values are present but decrease to 0.02–0.03 higher in the boundary layer. Larger backscatter values at low levels suggest a combination of urban pollution and weak Arctic haze trapped in surface inversions.\n\n**(B) 9 April:** A boundary layer up to approximately 1 km a.m.s.l. is evident, characterized by brighter backscatter and stronger depolarization signals. After 23:00 UTC, scud clouds begin forming at the boundary layer top. Above the boundary layer, greater backscatter and vertical structure are observed, including a distinct layer at approximately 2 km a.m.s.l. Elevated polarization values indicate the presence of non-spherical particles.\n\n**(C) 13 April:** Mid-level altostratus clouds dominated by ice, occasionally containing oriented ice plates, are observed alongside a supercooled altocumulus cloud layer at approximately 1 km a.m.s.l. A thin elevated aerosol layer is present at around 2 km a.m.s.l. before disappearing into the descending cloud base. Depolarization values suggest non-spherical particles, potentially associated with transported Asian dust or smoke layers.\n\n**(D) 15 April:** Aerosol signals are stronger and extend into broken cirrus layers up to approximately 4 km a.m.s.l. Backscatter patterns reveal stratification into fine horizontal layers, indicative of long-range transport. Near-surface δ values are low but increase to 0.07 in some aerosol layers, suggesting a vertical gradient in spherical and non-spherical particles.\n\n**(E) 21 April:** Strongly backscattering and depolarizing aerosols are observed, extending up to at least 4.5 km a.m.s.l. Enhanced backscatter and δ values (≈ 0.09) appear related to aerosol processing in an evaporating cirrus cloud fallstreak prior to 21:00 UTC. Near-surface aerosol layers exhibit δ values ranging from 0.02 to 0.05.\n\n**(F) 24 April:** A layered aerosol structure is observed beneath cirrostratus clouds. The lower aerosol layer yields average δ values of approximately 0.05, while the elevated layer at around 2 km a.m.s.l. generates δ values of 0.15, the highest recorded during the ARCTAS campaign.",

The area is characterized by a substrate composed of Mio-Pliocene conglomerates, gravel, sand, and coal-containing clay. In several locations, water with a high mineral salt content, particularly sodium chloride, emerges from the substrate, creating salt-affected soils. These soils are fragile, highly endangered, and exhibit significant spatial fragmentation, with varying salt concentrations across the area. The occurrence of such salt-affected habitats outside the Pannonian Plain is extremely rare in Serbia.

This increase is attributed to atmospheric warming and moistening. (b) Incoming shortwave radiation (SW_in) [W m⁻²], highlighting statistically significant increases along the ice sheet margins in response to sea ice forcing. (c) Net shortwave radiation (SW_net) [W m⁻²], demonstrating enhanced absorption of shortwave energy due to reduced surface albedo. (d) Albedo [-], illustrating a decrease caused by earlier melt onset, an expansion of the summer melt extent, and an increase in bare-ice area, which collectively trigger the melt-albedo feedback. Grey contours enclose areas where the response is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, based on a Student’s t-test. Only values corresponding to the glaciated portions of the grid cells are shown.",

Significant correlations are shaded.  \n(a) The AO shows a quadripolar correlation pattern in the North Atlantic, with negative correlations over Greenland, Northern Africa, and Southern Asia, and positive correlations from North America to Europe and Western Asia. This structure is observed primarily during the winter months (JFM). Over northern Asia, positive correlations are evident in both the annual AO and JFM NAO, with the AO's correlations persisting throughout the year (albeit weaker during NH summer), whereas NAO correlations are limited to the JFM season.  \n(b) The AAO reveals a nearly global distribution of significant correlations, with positive correlations over most oceanic areas, except for relatively small negative regions in Northern Africa, Asia, and Antarctica. In the austral summer (JFM and OND), negative correlations in Antarctica are stronger, while the positive correlations across the Southern Hemisphere are slightly reduced, indicating a more active Southern Hemisphere vortex during the warmer months.  \n(c) The SOI displays strong negative correlations with ET over the equatorial Pacific, Indian Ocean, and mid-latitude bands, while positive correlations appear in the subtropical Pacific and Southern Atlantic. This pattern is characteristic of ENSO, associated with changes in Rossby waves and temperature anomalies over the Pacific.  \n(d) The NH winter NAO shows a similar quadripolar structure to the AO, but with its correlation pattern confined to the JFM season, with significant positive correlations from North America to Western Asia and negative correlations over Greenland and Northern Africa.",
